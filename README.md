Overview
--------

aMule is a multi-platform client for the ED2K file sharing network and based on
the windows client eMule. aMule started in August 2003, as a fork of xMule,
which is a fork of lMule.

aMule currently supports Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Windows, MacOS X and X-Box on
both 32 and 64 bit computers.

aMule is intended to be as user friendly and feature rich as eMule and to
remain faithful to the look and feel of eMule so users familiar with either
aMule or eMule will be able switch between the two easily.

Since aMule is based upon the eMule codebase, new features in eMule tend to
find their way into aMule soon after their inclusion into eMule so users of
aMule can expect to ride the cutting-edge of ED2k clients.


Features
--------

* an all-in-one app called `amule`.
* a daemon app called `amuled`. It's amule but with no interface.
* a client for the server called `amulegui` to connect to a local or distant
  amuled.
* `amuleweb` to access amule from a web browser.
* `amulecmd` to access amule from the command line.


Compiling
---------

In general, compiling aMule should be as easy as running `configure` and `make`.
There are [detailed instructions][1] on the wiki for compiling on a number of
different platforms, though they may be outdated a bit... (updates are welcome).

[1]: http://wiki.amule.org/wiki/Compile		"How to compile and install aMule"


Setting Up
----------

aMule comes with reasonable default settings and should be usable as-is.
However, to receive a [HighID] you need to open aMule's ports on your
firewall and/or forward them on your router. Again, you'll find detailed
articles on the wiki helping you [get HighID][2] and [setting up firewall
rules][3] for aMule.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

We aren't perfect and so aMule isn't perfect, too. We know that. If you find a
bug or miss a feature you can report/request it either on the [forum], the
[bug tracker][4] or on [GitHub][5].

Contributing
------------

*Contributions are always welcome!*

You can contribute to aMule several ways:

* Contributing code. You can fix some bugs, implement new features, or
  whatever you want. The preferred way is opening a [pull request][6] on
  GitHub, but you can also post your patch on the [forum].
* Translating. You can [translate aMule][7], [translate the wiki][8] or
  [translate aMule's documentation][9] to your language.
* Fixing the wiki. aMule's wiki contains a lot of old, outdated information,
  that is simply not true anymore. One should read through the pages, update
  manuals and references and remove obsolete information.
