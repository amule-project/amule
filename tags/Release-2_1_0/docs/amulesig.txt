                aMule Online Signature specification
                ------------------------------------


 Introduction
--------------

  The online signature exports aMule's statistics in a simple text oriented format.

  It can be enabled within the Preferences dialogs of aMule (Preferenes -> Online Signature).

  Currently two formats of online signature are supported:
    * the original eMule online signature written to onlinesig.dat
    * the aMule online signature written to amulesig.dat

  This document will detail on the later one.


 Format

  The format of the file is a text file with 1 field per line.
