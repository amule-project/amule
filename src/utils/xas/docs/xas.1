.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxas\fR is a plugin for xchat. For loading see your xchat documentation. After loading 
type /xas and it will send statistics to the channel you are in. These 
are taken from your Online Signature file.
For this to work, you must enable the "Online Signature" option in aMule's preferences.

To enable it on every startup of xchat you can just run the autostart-xas script (in /usr/bin if you installed with \-\-prefix=/usr).
