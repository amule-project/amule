C AMULE STATS



This is a little app that i've been doing cause i really didnt liked aStats.
I was too slow, so i tried to do a little remake of it in c just to learn a 
bit more of c and do a nice app too.

Nice things to do if you have the time and want to contribute:

* Put an end to lines[] madness
* Get the mule to formally define onlinesig format and use that to access
  the fields, not meaningless offsets (needs a patch against/rewrite of
  amule[d].cpp:OnlineSig() at this time)
* Clean up confusing code
