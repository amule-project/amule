To build on MacOSX, there are some experimental scripts located in src/utils/scripts/MacOSX

An example basic flow to create an SVN build is to do the following from the root folder where this file is located:


mkdir Build
cd Build/
WXVERSION=svn WXPORT=cocoa MULECLEAN=YES ../src/utils/scripts/MacOSX/full_build.sh


Those commands would build a MacOSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) compatible application bundle for aMule and aMuleGUI
using the architecture of the build system ( i386 or x86_64 ), with the latest SVN vesion of wxWidgets.

Other parameters are explained upon execution of the script.

The above command was tested on MacOSX 10.7.1 Lion on a x86_64 architecture and provided valid binaries.
Unfortunately, other systems may fail silently, or loudly, and there is not much error reporting support.

Good luck!
