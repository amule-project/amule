.SH COMMANDS
All commands are case insensitive.
.SS Add \fI<eD2k-link>\fP | \fI<magnet-link>\fP
Adds an eD2k-link or a magnet-link to the core.

The eD2k link to be added can be:
.RS 3
.IP \(bu 2
a file link (ed2k://|file|...), it will be added to the download queue;
.IP \(bu 2
a server link (ed2k://|server|...), it will be added to the server list;
.IP \(bu 2
a serverlist link, in which case all servers in the list will be added to the server list.
.RE

The magnet link must contain the eD2k hash and file length.
.SS Cancel \fI<hash>\fP | \fI<number>\fP
Cancels the download specified by \fI<hash>\fR or \fI<number>\fR. To get the value use \fBshow\fR.
.SS Connect [ \fIkad\fP | \fIed2k\fP | \fI<ip|name>\fP ]
Connect to the network.

This will connect to all networks that are enabled in Preferences.

With the optional parameter you can specify which network to connect to. Giving
a server address in the form of IP:Port (where IP is either a dotted decimal
IPv4 address or a resolvable DNS name) aMule will connect to that server only.
.SS_untranslated Disconnect [ \fIed2k\fP | \fIkad\fP ]
Disconnect from all networks you are connected to, or just disconnect from the
specified network.
.SS Download \fI<number>\fP
Start downloading a file.

The \fI<number>\fR of a file from the last search has to be given.
Example: `download 12' will start to download the file with the number 12 of the
previous search.
.SS_untranslated Exit
Disconnect from amule/amuled and quit amulecmd.
.SS Get \fI<what>\fP
Get and display a preference value.

Available values for \fI<what>\fR:
.RS
.IP BwLimits 10
Get bandwidth limits.
.IP IPFilter 10
Get IPFilter preferences.
.RE
.SS Help [ \fI<command>\fP ]
Prints a short usage description.
If called without parameter, it shows a list of available commands.
If called with \fI<command>\fR, it shows a short description of the given command.
.SS Pause \fI<hash>\fP | \fI<number>\fP
Pauses the download specified by \fI<hash>\fR or \fI<number>\fR. To get the value use \fBshow\fR.
.SS Priority \fI<priority>\fP \fI<hash>\fP | \fI<number>\fP
Set priority of a download specified by \fI<hash>\fR or \fI<number>\fR.

Available values for \fI<priority>\fR:
.RS
.IP Auto 10
Automatic priority.
.IP High 10
High priority.
.IP Low 10
Low priority.
.IP Normal 10

Show log.
.IP Servers 10
Show servers list.
.IP UL 10

.RE
.SS_untranslated Shutdown
Shutdown the remote running core (amule/amuled).
This will also shut down the text client, since it is unusable without a running core.
.SS Statistics [ \fI<number>\fP ]
Show statistics tree.

The optional \fI<number>\fR in the range of 0-255 can be passed as argument to this
command, which tells how many entries of the client version subtree should be
shown. Passing 0, or omitting it means `unlimited'.

Example: `statistics 5' will show only the top 5 versions for each client
type.
.SS_untranslated Status
Show connection status, current up/download speeds, etc.
.SH NOTES
.SS Paths
For all options which take a \fI<path>\fR value, if the \fIpath\fR contains no
directory part (i.e. just a plain filename), then it is considered to be under
the aMule configuration directory, \fI~/.aMule\fR.
.SS Languages
The \fI<lang>\fR parameter for the \fB\-l\fR option has the following form: \fIlang\fR[\fB_\fILANG\fR][\fB.\fIencoding\fR][\fB@\fImodifier\fR]
where \fIlang\fR is the primary language, \fILANG\fR is a sublanguage/territory,
\fIencoding\fR is the character set to use and \fImodifier\fR
allows the user to select a specific instance of localization data within a
single category.

For example, the following strings are valid:
.RS
.RB_untranslated de
.br
.RB_untranslated de_DE
.br
.RB_untranslated de_DE.iso88591
.br
.RB_untranslated de_DE@euro
.br
.RB_untranslated de_DE.iso88591@euro
.RE

Though all the above strings are accepted as valid language definitions,
\fIencoding\fR and \fImodifier\fR are yet unused.

In addition to the format above, you can also specify full language names in
English - so \fB\-l german\fR is also valid and is equal to \fB\-l de_DE\fR.

When no locale is defined, either on command-line or in config file, system
default language will be used.
.SH FILES
~/.aMule/remote.conf
.SH EXAMPLE
Typically amulecmd will be first run as:
.PP
\fBamulecmd\fR \fB\-h\fR \fIhostname\fR \fB\-p\fR \fIECport\fR \fB\-P\fR \fIECpassword\fR \fB\-w\fR
.PP
or
.PP
\fBamulecmd\fR \fB\-\-create-config-from\fR=\fI/home/username/.aMule/amule.conf\fR
.PP
These will save settings to \fI$HOME/.aMule/remote.conf\fR, and later you only need to type:

.B_untranslated amulecmd

Of course, you don't have to follow this example.
