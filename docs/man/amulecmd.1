.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Displays the current version number.
.SH COMMANDS
All commands are case insensitive
.SS \fBAdd\fR <ed2k-link>
Adds an ed2k-linkto the core.

The ed2k link to be added can be:
.br
*) a file link (ed2k://|file|...), it will be added to the download queue,
.br
*) a server link (ed2k://|server|...), it will be added to the server list,
.br
*) or a serverlist link, in which case all servers in the list will be added to the server list.

This command must have an argument.
.SS \fBCancel\fR <hash>
Cancels the download specified by hash. To get the hash use \fIshow\fR.
.SS \fBConnect\fR (kad|ed2k<ip|name>)
Connect to the network.

This will connect to all networks that are enabled in Preferences.

When giving ed2k as parameter, it connects only to ed2k-network to servers in your
serverlist. You may also optionally specify a server address in IP:Port form, to
connect to that server only. The IP must be a dotted decimal IPv4 address, or a
resolvable DNS name.

When giving kad, it connects to Kad only.
.SS \fBDisconnect\fR (ed2k|kad)

Disconnect from all networks you are cionnected to, or just disconnect from the

.SH NOTES
.SS Paths
For all options which take a \fI<path>\fR value, if the \fIpath\fR contains no
directory part (i.e. just a plain filename), then it is considered to be under
the aMule configuration directory, \fI~/.aMule\fR.
.SS LANGUAGES
The \fI<lang>\fR parameter for the \fB\-l\fR option has the following form: \fIlang\fR[\fB_\fILANG\fR][\fB.\fIencoding\fR][\fB@\fImodifier\fR]
where \fIlang\fR is the primary language, \fILANG\fR is a sublanguage/territory,
\fIencoding\fR is the character set to use and \fImodifier\fR
"allows the user to select a specific instance of localization data within a
single category".
.PP
For example, the following strings are valid:
.br
de
.br
de_DE
.br
de_DE.iso88591
.br
de_DE@euro
.br
de_DE.iso88591@euro
.PP
Though all the above strings are accepted as valid language definitions,
\fIencoding\fR and \fImodifier\fR are yet unused.
.PP
In addition to the format above, you can also specify full language names in
English - so \fB\-l german\fR is also valid and is equal to \fB-l de_DE\fR.
.PP
When no locale is defined, either on command-line or in config file, system
default language will be used.
.SH FILES
~/.aMule/remote.conf
.SH EXAMPLE
Typically amulecmd will be first run as:
.PP
\fBamulecmd\fR \fB\-h\fR \fIhostname\fR \fB\-p\fR \fIECport\fR \fB\-P\fR \fIECpassword\fR \fB\-w\fR
.PP
or
.PP
\fBamulecmd\fR \fB\-\-create-config-from\fR=\fI/home/username/.aMule/amule.conf\fR
.PP
These will save settings to \fI$HOME/.aMule/remote.conf\fR, and later you only need to type:
.PP
.B amulecmd
.PP
Of course, you don't have to follow this example.
