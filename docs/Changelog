Version 2.1.1 - The "There can be only two! Point one! Point one!" version
----------
2006-03-18

	GonoszTopi:
		* Fixed sources coming from an 'Unknown' origin.

	ken:
		* Fixed Mac aMule showing erroneous version number in Get Info.
		* Disabled the HTTP download progress dialog on Mac (again) because
		  it causes crashes.
		* Suppressed an error dialog on failure to lookup the host's domain
		  name.  Demoted it to just a message in the log.
		* Fixed a bug in ed2kHelperScript.app (the Mac ed2k link handler)
		  which prevented it from working properly if there was a space in the
		  path to the aMule application.  Thanks to Gomaaz for finding this bug.
		* Eliminated false reports of failure to execute the on-completion
		  command.  This happened with amuled and an on-completion command which
		  completes quickly.  Thanks to s0undt3ch for reporting this bug.

	Kry:
		* Fixed a bug on sending sources where sources won't be send to a client 
		  uploading from us if he uses multipacket.
		* Fixes some crashes, on systray dying, tho not all till wx is patched.
		* Fixed some possible problem with userhash generation, that could lead 
		  a void userhash.
		* Fixed defs.h include on MuleDebug.h causing compilation problems on 
		  some systems (must be first wx include).
		* Fixed search type "Any"
		* Fixed translation of empty strings, which is reserved to gettext and
		  must never be used.
		* Fixed the aMule.app container lacking a Frameworks/ folder and thus 
		  making the generate_package script fail.
		* Fixed compilation of wxCas with wxWidgets CVS (2.7.x)
		* Fixed ED2K id wrongly used on kad-only setups.
		* Added the --reset-config flag
		* Fixed Kad's sources/nodes search results, based on a patch by tatikiran
		  and further modified by John (eMule) and me.
		* Removed Razorback 2's stats while it's gone.
		* Disabled vertical toolbar on Windows while wxWidgets doesn't fix it.
		* Fixed aMule failing to find configuration folder and any folder that
		  finishes with a "\" on windows. This leaded to shared folders not being 
		  shared, too.
		* Fixed drives on windows not being correctly tested.
		* Changed default server.met

	Radek:
		* Fixed amulemd output not being printed immediatly when running in a
		  mingw terminal.
		* Added missing include to GetTickCount.h, which caused the function
		  declaration to be missing in some cases.

	Raziel:
		* Fixed "0000690 bug for browse windows in amulegui"
	
	Xaignar:
		* Fixed problem with recursivly sharing folders that hadn't been
		  expanded in the tree ctrl.
		* Improved detection of external Crypto++ versions.
		* Fixed somee possibly crashes, caused by failed unicode convertions.
		* Improved error-checking when creating the .aMule data folders.
		* Fixed problem with searching for files of type 'Program', if a
		  search of a different filetype had been done just before.
		* Fixed a problem with shared files, where danling pointers to client
		  objects could be left in some cases.
		* Changed the way MD4 hashes are converted from Base16, in order to
		  improve error-checking. This adds aditional safety to places such as
		  parsing of ED2K links and adding of friends.
		* Fixed bug where clients would be removed from the list of Kademlia
		  clients if the hash, ID or IP changed. This should only happen when
		  the client is deleted.
		* Fixed various problems with logging during startup, including a 
		  crash in amuled if an alert was to be displayed.
		* Fixed the HTTPDownload dialog by using events rather than relying
		  on being able to pause the main loop when sending notifications.
		  Also properly aMulified the dialog.
		* Entries for debug-logging are now always saved to the amule.conf
		  file, to allow amuled users to enable these manually. Before, the
		  entries were only written for enabled debuglog-types.
		* Fixed problem in loading of known.met, which would result in
		  duplicate shared files alternating between which file was actually
		  shared. This resulted in statistics for the file being 'lost'.
		* Added locking to the ed2k utility, to prevent races when many links
		  added at once.
		* Changed the way CFile retrieves the file-length, which was causing
		  problems with files shared from a remote drive. 
		* Fixed problems with representing 64b values on windows, caused by
		  imcompatible extensions to printf. Thanks to Radek.
		* Improved error messages on startup, when a folder is found to have
		  inadequate permissions.
		* Fixed problems with identifying reconnecting clients, which would
		  cause a number of problems, including exessive bans.
		* Fixing right-clicking (for recursive sharing) only being possible on
		  the directory icon, but not the label.
		* Fixed sorting by client-version on the downloadlistctrl (bug #763).
		* Changed the sort-order of A4AF sources, so that these are always
		  shown last. This fixes bug #761.
		* Fixed assertion in the downloadlistctrl, caused by a bug in
		  wxMemoryDC. This would trigger when a complete file was shown.
		* When a missing shared file is encountered, unshare just that file,
		  instead of rechecking everything, since that would cause noticible
		  lag for people sharing many files.
		* Fixed exec-on-completion being run even if the file failed
		  to perform its completion.
		* Fixed the sanity check for the min/max ext. search parameters, which
		  would cause the min value to be ignored unless a greater value had
		  been set for the max field.
		* Fixed unicode searches, caused by mismatching string conversions.
		* Adding missing exception-handler to the the function searching for
		  shared files. Without this, a failure to retrieve a filesize would
		  result in aMule terminating.
		* Fixed userspecified CPPFLAGS being overwritten by the CXXFLAGS
		  by configure. Thanks to Gerd78.
		* Removed references to amulecmdgui and amulewebgui, which had been
		  left behind from when the utilities were removed.
		* Overrode wxConsoleAppTraits's WaitForChild function for aMuled,
		  allowing wxExecute to be used asyncroniously. This fixes problems
		  with using the exec-on-completion functionality.
		* Improved sanity checks for the TTS implementation.
		* Changed paused state to stopped state in some cases, which had been
		  incorrectly changed to paused by myself.
		* Added Maximize/Minimize buttons to the file details dialog.
		* Fixed dangling pointers left behind, leading to crashes when a
		  server.met file containing dead severs was loaded.

	Special Thanks To:
		* All the translaters who did such a great and fast job.

		* Fixed possible crashes on dereferencing NULL pointer, specially on EC 
		   tag creation on UpDownClients.
		* Separated CClientCredits and CClientCreditsList to diferent files:
		   the later is not needed on remote GUI while the former is.
		* Moved some functions for ID check to theApp, to remove the
		   includes needed on each file, cutting down compilation time.
		* CClientCredits is not more a friend class of CClientCreditsList.
		* Split CClientReqSocket from ListenSocket.*, and renamed to 
		   CClienTCPSocket to keep coherence with CClientUDPSocket.
		* Removed event handler local vars on server and client sockets, and moved 
		   the classes out of the .h, because those are no needed anywhere else.
		* Removed the possibility of bootstrapping Kad from a host.
		* Fixed the stale unknown clients caused by unanswered kad-buddy requests.
		   The new KADEMLIABUDDYTIMEOUT is 10 minutes. More than enough.
		* Connect/Disconnect button works properly now. Disconnection happens on any 
		   network connected, and connection on the selected networks on preferences.
		* Added a Disconnect button for ED2K too.
		* Fixed possible crash on startup.
		* Tray icon is now shown as connected if any network is (ed2k or kad)
		* A lot of class separation and file/class renaming, to prepare the build for...
		* Build system changed:
		   - Added some intermediate libs to avoid double-compiles:
			     (Binary compatible files only)
			   - libmuleappcommon.a -> Common to all aMule derived apps
			   - libmuleappcore.a -> Common to amuled/amule
			   - libmuleappgui.a -> Common to amulegui/amule
		   - Also changed some files to increase the amount of 
		     binary compatible files. Would be great to increase 
			 this number, but sadly theApp. access is not binary
			 compatible (different base classes).
		   - Created two amule-independant libs:
			   - libcommon.a -> Common to all apps
			   - libecc.a -> Common to all EC apps
			 Those are now on libs/ folder.
		* More changes to build and libs. libeccommon now includes ECSocket, 
		   and CRemoteConnection is used to connect to a remote core.
		* Make libec independant from libmulecommon
		* Call realize to fix toolbar on Mac.
		* Open wiki on F1 for help :)
		* Stats have a 64bits, not 32bits, uptime number.
		* No more EC extra needed for having a remote app, yay. Just link to 
		   libec.a and use the CRemoteConnector->ConenctToCore and stuff. This

		* Enable connect/disconnect Kad from remote gui.
		* Some basic warnings on value changes for preferences.

		* Properly swap IPs when doing logging in Kad.
		* Avoid trying to close the file multiple times when resuming a
		  part-file that failed to complete.

	Phoenix:
		* Removed wxGTK and wxGTK-devel dependencies from the spec
		  file. They don't work on all distros, even worse, don't always
		  work with Fedora Core.
		* Created a new spec file, compliant with Fedora Core.
		* Fixed a crash when aMule was shut down by amulecmd and an
		  assert happened.
		* Fixed asserts on exit about non-empty lists when aMule was

		  compatibility with old HP-UX systems.

	Ramiro:
		* Patches to compile on a NSLU2 (ARM).

	RazZziel:
		* Changes on parent ownership on windows. Partially fixes 
		   0000690: List of windows that can be overlapped by main 
		                   window and leave aMule apparently freezed

	schtroumpf:
		* File rating in search dialog.
		* New file rating icons.
		* Replaced file rating good/bad with a rating average like in emule.
		* Amule submits file rating to the server.

	Seagull:
		* Fixed a small bug on client list view.

	shakraw:
		* Merged with 2.0.3 latest fixes (r4630, r4631, r4633, r4639)

	stefanero:
		* Fixed cas,wxCas and xas infos for Kad when only connected to
		Kad
		* Imported amps in aMule source

	thedude0001:
		* Added CVS snapshot date to frame title.
		* Fixed #560: "aMuleWebDLG and aMuleCMDDLG do not report version"

	volpol:
		* A4AF transfer speed display fix

	Xaignar:
		* Fixed the possibility of crashing when sending a message to a non-
		  friend client, caused by the fact that the client could be deleted
		  before the user entered the message. Also prevented attempts at
		  sending messages clients that wern't ready.
		* Fixed crash when '--version' was used, caused by an uninitialized
		  pointer. Serveral other uninitialized pointers were also fixed.
		* Fixed assert in the Type-To-Select code which would trigger when
		  items were removed and the old tts index pointed past the last item.
		* Fixed kad-searches with a filetype specified not producing any
		  results, caused by using obsolete type-strings.
		* Added missing calls to va_end at places where va_start is called.
		* Remove unneeded calls to wxMutexGuiEnter/Leave.
		* Fixed the listctrls asserting if one were to click past the end of
		  the last column header.
		* Fixed unhandled-exception handling in unittests, which had been
		  broken when they were made console apps.
		* Fixed sscanf call in PHP lexer, which had switched the source and
		  the format arguments.
		* Performed audit of printf type calls. Serveral bugs caused by using
		  the wrong printf variant were fixed in the webserver. All instances
		  of calls to sprintf variants were changed to snprintf to prevent
		  buffer overruns and calls to printf that passed a dynamic string as
		  the format string were changed to prevent using untrusted format
		  strings. Lastly a few places where widechar and char where mixed
		  were fixed.
		* Avoided checking the same folders multiple times when looking for
		  shared files, by ensuring that duplicate entries (from categories,
		  etc) are ignored.
		* Fixed minor mem-leak in CTimer.
		* Deleting a static server now also removes it from the static list.
		* Fixed disabling of graphs while the prefs-dialog is still open.
		* Fixed logging on UDP-sockets displaying an integer value rather
		  than a dot-IP.
		* Made the ipfilter.dat URL field independant of the auto-update
		  check-box, to allow for easier manual updates.
		* Fixed log-events not being written the logfile on full daemon.
		* Improved displaying of errors when starting the webserver from
		  amuled.
		* Allow resuming of files that error'd out during completetion.
		* When checking if a file is already being downloaded/shared, check if
		  the actual file is still available. This allows redownloading of
		  shared files that have been removed, without having to reload the
		  list of shared files.
		* Added checks to see if the target filesystem is fat32 when
		  completing files, and removing known illegal chars in that case.
		* Important log-lines are now bolded in the log textctrl.
		* Redirect wxWidget log-events to the aMule log. This avoid the popups
		  that wxWidgets would display by default.
		* Made the unittests proper wxConsoleApps.
		* Open the preferences dialog non-modally, so that it doesn't block
		  the main GUI.
		* Switched manual path-joining to using the generic function.
		* Fixed the "pause all" and "cancel all" commands via remote.
		* Fixed bad replies on sharedfiles-list requests when public viewing
		  of the list is disabled.
		* When a message is filtered, always display the "Message filtered
		  ..." log-entry instead of the "New message ..", rather than only
		  displaying the "Message filtered" the first time, and then only the
		  "New Message" the following times.
		* Cleaned up the file-completion thread and fixed the following:
		  * If creation or starting of the thread failed, the file would
		    silently fail to complete.
		  * If the file was renamed, the download queue show the old name.
		  * If the file was renamed and didn't have an extension, the "(x)"
		    component would be added to the front of the filename.
		  * When checking for unused filenames, if an file with the same name
		    exists, the path would be a changed to the standard incoming
			folder regardles of the file's category.
		  * wxFileExists was used to check for the existance of the files,
		    possibly leading to false negatives with unicoded filenames.
		* Fixed files being added in stopped-mode when the "Add downloads in
		  paused mode" setting was enabled. Since the "Start next ..." works
		  on paused files, this makes more sense.
		* Fixed bug #513. When "Start next ..." and "Same category .." was
		  enabled, we would still select downloads from the wrong category,
		  when there was still paused files in the desired category.
		* Changed the StopPausedFile from actually stopping the file to simply
		  clearing the sources, as this is the intended goal. Stopping the
		  file was wrong, considering that it would leave a window of one hour
		  in which the "Start next paused download" code would be useful.
		* Added generic function for joining two paths.
		* Dont allow renaming of downloads that are being completed.
		* Made the comment-list dialog resizable.
		* Enabled use of tool-tips on all wx-variants.
		* Fixed Kad-Info and ED2K-Info lists not having any scroll-bars.
		* Fixed compressed Kad packets having the wrong procotol set. Thanks
		  to Gnucco for the pointing this out.
		* Only show the root-item circle for incomplete part-files.
		* Prevent the adding of friends without IPs, via the clientlistctrl.
		* Fixed serveral problems caused by the reuse of the preferences
		  dialog window.
		* Improved the popup menu on the downloads listctrl.
		* Fixed starting of next download being called under the wrong
		  conditions when files were deleted via remote.
		* Dropped the HTML version of ed2k-links.
		* Fixed shutdown of the amulegui when the systray is enabled.
		* Fixed bug #359. The preferences dialog is now reused between
		  sessions, so the last used page and the state of the shared-files
		  tree is remembered.
		* Only enable the host-version of ed2k-links when a hostname has been
		  specified (still no perferences widget for this).
		* Fixed bug #700. The partfile conversion window is now raised
		  properly when the button is clicked again (doesn't work with gtk1).
		* Improved logging in CFile in situations where system-calls are used.
		* Improved permissions checks for the .aMule folder. Also added checks
		  for the Temp and Incoming folders.
		* Fixed an unconditional Close call when creating part-files, which
		  happened even if opening the file failed.
		* Fixed the names of friends being cleared on the chat-notebook when
		  the clientobject disconnected.
		* Ensures that both the downloadlistctrl and sharedfileslistctrl are
		  both up to date when a file has been renamed. Also switched to using
		  the same dialog on both listctrls.
		* Check for items being sorted was moved to the CMuleListCtrl class,
		  and to fix flickering on the server-list and and searchresult-lists,
		  which is caused by insertions and deletions, the list is resorted
		  instead, if an item is out of order after an update.
		* Drop the use of jugle.net. It's dead, Jim!
		* Changed the 'Clear' button on the search-page to only clear
		  search-results. The 'Reset' button now takes care of the text-field
		  and any extra parameter-fields. Serveral fixes were made to make
		  sure all fields were properly cleared.
		* Properly set filtering on newly added search-results.
		* Fixed broken sanity check in AddDownload
		* Bug #688. Made the popup menu on the searchlistctrl similar to those
		  on the downloadlistctrl and sharedfileslist. 
		* Added serveral missing exception-handlers.
		* Ensured that the internal libs are only built when needed.
		* Fixed ed2k-links causing duplicate entries on the download-queue and
		  made the sanity checks in AddDownload safer.
		* Made the interal CryptoPP files part of the one of the temporary
		  libraries to avoid building it three times (amule, amuled, amulegui).
		* Removed printf-call from signal-handler.
		* Unified download-handling on the search-page and fixed the download
		  button, which was broken by previous commits.
		* Fixed a leak in the UDP sockets which occurs when packets are sent
		  via a dead or closed socket object.
		* GetInstallPrefix is broken on wxWidgets 2.6.2, so only use it when
		  building autopackages (since we can patch the sources). 
		* Improved logging in case of clients requesting invalid file-data.
		* Cleaned up autoconfigure files a bit.
		* Added sanity checks to the downloadqueue's AddDownload function to
		  catch this, should the problem appear again.
		* Added checks to avoid loading duplicate partfiles, since downloads
		  are identified by the hash. A warning is now issued when this
		  happens.
		* Add a "Download in category" sub-menu to the right-click menu on
		  searchresult lists and moved download handling to CSearchListCtrl.
		  This fixes bug #673.
		* Specify if debugging was enabled on version strings.
		* Ctrl+a now select all items on listctrls.
		* Make aMule relocatable in regards to locales, and amuleweb
		  relocateable in regards to templates. This is needed to allow usage
		  of autopackage.
		* RotateReferences() now properly handles shifts larger than the
		  number of files present and use std::rotate.
		* Files that are larger than the limit imposed by the ed2k network are
		  now filtered from search-results.
		* Fixed drawing of the first column on the shared-files list, caused
		  by the upgrades to the listctrl code.
		* Made one-shot CTimers interruptable and fixes a memleak in the Start
		  functions caused by not freeing old threads.
		* Upgraded our included listctrl with the bugfixes from v2.6.1 
		  and v2.6.2 of wxWidgets.
		* Fixed a couple of AICH log messages that were mixing unicoded
		  strings and non-unicoded strings.
		* Made middle-clicking on the client-list work in the same way as
		  middleclicking on the downloadqueue, and cleaned up click-
		  handling in general.
		* Fixes the overhead-handling code in CTimer which wouldn't 
		  check if overhead was larger than the period, resulting in 
		  calls to Sleep with an underflown value. Also fixed events
		  possibly being lost due to overhead.
		* Fixes crashes due to uncaught read-past-EOF exceptions when a
		  cliented requested a block from a file past the end of the 
		  actual file-length.
		* If aMuled is run and ECs are enabled and no password is set,
		  dont reset the EC setting, but rather display instructions
		  that specify what to do before terminating.
		* Added warning which will be displayed if aMule is run as 
		  root, which is adviced against for obvious reasons.
		* Removed the --disable-systray configure option, since extra
		  libraries are not required now. To disable the systray now,
		  simply use the preferences.
		* Removed support for wxWidgets version older than v2.6.0. Support
		  for wxWidgets 2.4.2 had been broken for a while, without anyone
		  complaining, and the v2.6.x branch has been out for long enough
		  to make usage of the v2.5.x branch nonsensical.
		* Added workarounds for the wxWidgets memleak when using GTK2 on
		  versions of wxWidgets < 2.6.2 to the remaining places where this 
		  would occur.
		* Changed failure on file-seeking into a catchable exception,
		  rather than a runtime error. 
		* Fixed a crash on shutdown caused by the listensocket now being
		  closed which caused a call to Accept to return NULL.
		* Fixed compilation with GCC-4.1 (snapshot).
		* Syncronized look of client-icons on download-queue and the
		  client-lists (upload, queued, all), so that all display the same
		  information.
		* Display an icon when downloads have comments but no rating, and
		  added the same icons for both to the shared-files list, making it
		  easier to keep track of what files are commented/rated.
		* Fixed all warnings reported by -Wshadow and -Wundef.
		* Added the compiler-flags -Wshadow and -Wundef, and changed
		  configuration such that warnings are enabled for both debug and 
		  non-debug builds.
		* Largly reworked the CTimer class:
			* Fixed all timers sending events with the same ID.
			* Removed use of static variables which would cause troubles if
			  more than one repeat-timer was used.
			* Ensured that no event would be sent if the timer was stopped
			  while sleeping.
			* Improved thread-safely a lot and made the threads detachable.
			* Added function for terminating all timer-thread on shutdown, so
			  that no timer-threads will be left running.
		* Fixed SSE2 support check in the embedded cryptoPP code, for gcc-4.
		* Fixed a couple of bugs caused by variable-shadowing.
		* Flush log-buffers when waiting for either of the hashing threads to
		  terminate.
		* Removed manipulation of gui-mutex in AICH thread, which are no
		  longer needed due to changes in log-handling.
		* Removed local variable which shadowed a variable when checking if a
		  client was a friend. This caused the friend to link to said client
		  even after the client had been deleted, since the client would not
		  unlink itself from the friend.
		* Only store the descriptions of IP-Ranges for the ipfilter on
		  debug-builds, since this value is not used on non-debug builds and
		  can account for serveral MB of used memory.
		* Fixed new-connections being opened on shutdown and the new clients
		  being created. This should fix the assertion in CClientList.
		* Added a call to wxUpdateUIEvent's SetMode function, to reduce the
		  ammount of unnessesary events being generated.
		* Fixed clearing of background for list-items that do not have a
		  background color set.
		* Resized a couple of buttons that were too small to display their
		  image. This fixes bug #648.
		* Improved double-buffering of listctrls a bit.
		* Fixed auto-sorting checks on the server-list, which were inverted,
		  causing items that were already sorted to be re-position and so
		  forth. This was the source of the large ammount of flicker on the
		  server list.
		* Fixed the "Time Remaining" column on the downloadqueue when no
		  downloads were taking place.
		* Removing unneeded checks for fat32 filesystems.
		* Improved handling of closing of the preferences dialog.
		* Changing kad-nodes label to display "Nodes (0)" by default.
		* Force the UBT to take a increasingly longer nap between loops when
		  it fails to send anything, which ensures that it wont go bananas it
		  is unable to upload at the specified rate. This would happen for
		  instance if the limit is set to a value higher than the physical
		  connection limit. This fixes bug #606.
		* Re-added the node count above the kad-graph, and a few other changes. 
		* Removing unused color-setting, which was causing problems with the
		  kad-graph. For this change to take effect, you will have to remove
		  your StatColor* entrires from amule.conf.
		* Fixed bug on the kad-nodes statistics, where entries added while the
		  dialog was not displayed would have the value of zero. This fixed
		  bug #652.
		* Fix for selecting tabs (+ popup menu) via right-clicking on GTK2.
		* Allow previewing of audio-files, fixing bug #654.
		* Reworked the ED2KLink class:
			* Simplified parsing a lot.
 			* Moved the task of handling sources specified in file-links
			  almost entirely to the download queue.
			* Improved error checking.
 			* Implemented handling (not just parsing) of part-hashes and
			  master-hashes specified via file-links.
			* Fixed support for multiple sources in a file link, which fixes
			  bug #506
		* Properly replicate file permissions when copying files via the
		  UTF8_CopyFile function. Also removed an unneeded free/malloc set of
		  calls by allocating on the stack.
		* Added the ability to execute commands when a download has been
		  completed and removed some unimplemented options from the
		  preferences. This fixes bug #152.
		* Update the "clients on queue" count when purging clients. This
		  should resolve bug #478.
		* Properly disable filtering on searches when filtering is supposed to
		  be disabled. This approach does also not remove the existing
		  search-string if filtering is toggled on and off.
		* Fixed the kad-statistics using the colors of the download-statistics
		  rather than its own settings.
		* Implementing kad-node graph. This patch does not add support for the
		  graphs on the webserver.
		* Removing trailing "i"s from time values created by CastSecondsToHM.
		* Reduced log verbosity when deleting downloads.
		* Sync deletion of items on friend, download and server lists via the
		  Delete key. This resolves bug #649.
		* We now completly disallow the sharing of the users home-dir.
		* Changed the check for file-size in the hasher-thread, which was
		  using a too large value, greater than what is actually supported by
		  the ed2k network.
		* Fixed compilation on the x86 version of MacOSX.
		* Added specialization of the CRangeMap class which doesn't contain a
		  user-value per range, dubbed CRangeSet.
		* Added the IP and port of friends to the initial text when opening a
		  chat window. This should more easily allow for adding of clients to
		  the friends list if they message us. This is not a final solution.
		* Added sanity checks to CStatisticsDlg's getColors function.
		* Changed some CList instances to stl containers.
		* Fixed bug in CKnownFile where auto-priorities would be updated
		  before the source had been added to the list. 
		* Improved testing of CRangeMap's iterator classes.
		* Final changes to CFile, CMemFile and CFileDataIO:
			* Documentation of the classes and functions completed.
			* Completed unittests for CSafeFileIO, CFile, CMemFile.
			* Changed systems calls to explicitly use 64b calls on win32
			  systems, since win32 uses 32b calls by default.
			* Lots of other small improvements.
		* When sorting search-results by type, sort items with the same type
		  by their extensions.
		* Added the hotkey Ctrl-Q for closing aMule.
		* Dont store the results of unittest that didn't fail when executed,
		  since we ignore successes anyway. This causes a great speedup on
		  some tests, where a large number of checks are made.
		* Set the update frequency for the statistics, fixing bug #637. 
		* Strip 's from paths set via amule-config-file, resolving bug #638.
		* Reworked the TTS implementation, so that control-sequences are
		  passed to the widget, improved walking through the list by
		  repeatedly pressing a letter and finally fixed the use of
		  arrow-keys on some locales.
		* Also clear the log-line (lower-left) when the log is reset.
		* Replaces a few "wxASSERT(x); if (!x) return" with wxCHECK(x)s.
		* Force an update when the file has been completed, which allows the
		  DownloadListCtrl to detect that a file has been completed.
		* Optimized the unicode-conversion functions, which were causing
		  unneeded copies to be made.
		* Only enable the clear-completed button and menu-item when there are
		  completed items. This resolves bug #403.
		* Fixes deadlock triggered when a UDP socket tried to recover.
		* Fixed compilation for 64b systems, caused by mismatching parameter
		  types in a pure-virtual function.
		* Improved sanity checking of DNS resolutions in CServerUDPSocket.
		* Fixed a few calls to CFile's Create function, which were using a
		  wrong parameter type for the second argument.
		* Changed MuleUnit to output results as soon as possible.
		* Added generic CMuleUDPSocket class, which unifies common tasks such
		  sending, receiving, error-handling and interfacing with the 
		  UploadBandwidthThrottler. I also included a recovery mechanism
		  for when a socket becomes invalid, which fixes bug #489.
		* Fixed crashes when kad is enabled but the ClientUDP-socket is not.
		* Fixes names not being prepended to debug messages.
		* Fixed potential mem-leak on the download-queue.
		* Fixed secondary sort-ordering on the download-queue.
		* Changed source-handling so that we can distinguish between sources
		  returned from the local server and sources returned from global
		  servers.
		* Added debugging messages for when sources are received from an
		  unknown file.
		* Removed remaining fake-check stuff and fixed assert repported by
		  stefanero, caused by a bit of fake-check code left behind.
		* Changed handling of log-entries from worker-threads, so that these
		  are queued rather than sent immediatly. This is needed since adding
		  a pending event requires locking of the gui-mutex, which easily
		  leads to deadlocks.
		* Fixed race-condition in the download-queue, where multiple DNS
		  resolution threads could be created for the same hostname.
		* Fixed an assertion in the kad-dialog caused by an insertion at an
		  invalid index. This only happened for some versions of wxWidgets.
		* Fixed color-updating of items being downloaded from the search-lists.
		* Re-implemented rating icons on search-result lists using the builtin
		  support for icons on wxListCtrls. This saves us from having to
		  manually draw everything and fixes the crash on using TTS.
		* Fixed a bug in the ObservableQueue class, which would cause UDP
		  requests to servers to be done only once, whereafter no further 
		  requests would be made. This was the source of the problem with
		  aMule not finding sources for newly added files.
		* Fixed a race-condition in aMule when shutting down while a global
		  search is running. This should resolve bug #563.
		* Reworked the CServerUDPSocket class a bit, most importantly, changed
		  it so that servers being deleted while we are doing a DNS lookup on
		  their hostname cant result in accessing of dangling pointers. This
		  should bug #581.
		* Fixed bug #558. Sources not being sorted when the download-queue was
		  sorted by the "Time Remaining" column.
		* Cleaned up file-ratings and comments handling:
			* Dropped the m_hasRating and m_hasBadRating booleans, as these
			  can be infered from the value itself.
			* Dropped the SetHasComment and SetHasRating functions, as this is
			  more safely handled in UpdateFileRatingCommentAvail.
			* Cleaned up the UpdateFileRatingCommentAvail function since it
			  was rather messy.
			* Removed a unnescesarry call to Notify_DownloadCtrlUpdateItem in
			  the function ProcessMuleCommentPacket, since this is already
			  done in the UpdateFileRatingCommentAvail function.
		* Added sanity checks to the code that made use of said file-ratings.
		* Added sanity checks against file-ratings read from other clients,
		  since we later rely on these values to be in a specific range.
		* Fixed some uninitialized variables.
		* Make ascending the default sort-order and fixed loading of the
		  sort-order in the CMuleListCtrl class.
		* Added a missing call to Skip in the TTS event-handler for item
		  selections, so that subclasses will still be notified.
		* Reworked CMuleListCtrl and added support for "Type To Select", or
		  the ability to select items by typing parts of their name. The
		  selection is made against the start of the text-strings and is
		  case-insensitive.
		* Fixed some more warnings.
		* Fixed compilation problems with external CryptoPP sources, caused by
		  a preprocessor define which clashed with a variable name. 
		* Changed the length parameters of the read-funtions in the CFileDataIO
		  interface to be unsigned, since signed lengths doesn't
		  make any sense in this regard and makes error-checking harder.
		* Merged checks for the ARM and Sparc architectures.
		* Changed a call to bzero to memset, since win32 doesn't have bzero.
		* Fixed remaning issues with template usage in MuleUnit.
		* Cleaned up error handling in CClientUDPSocket a bit, and added
		  error-checks to CServerUDPSocket. This should allow us to see if the
		  INVSOCK errors are local to CClientUDPSocket or if they happen to
		  all wxDataGramSockets.
		* Added check requiring a valid port to CClientUDPSocket's SendPacket
		  function, since we apprently tried to send to port 0 once in a
		  while.
		* Moved adding of sources read from seeds files out of the
		  exception-handler, to avoid the obscuring of possible bugs elsewhere.
		* Final touches made on the CMemFile class, which includes cleanups, 
		  improved error-checking and complete documentation.
		* Added missing destructor to CUInt128, which was causing compilation 
		  failure for some GCC-4 users.
		* Fixed an attempt to fprintf a wide-char string.
		* Enabled the use of kad with wxWidget versions 2.5.x.
		* Improved handling of uncaught exceptions in MuleUnit and changed the
		  library from being an actual wx application, since we only need to
		  make use of wxWidgets classes.
		* Expanded the CFormat testcases a bit, to better cover use of illegal
		  values and the checks against those.
		* Improved checking of value convertions in CFormat, now properly
		  detects nagative values converted to signed values and signed to
		  negative, plus some other situations.
		* Fixed format-strings in the statistics-tree that did not specify a
		  type large enough to actually represent the possible values.
		* Disabled certian tool-tips for wxWidgets-2.4.2, since the calls made
		  use of functions that were introduced in wxWidgets-2.6.x.
		* Moved archive-unpacking functions from the HTTP-thread to
		  FileFunctions.*. This allows for compressed files to be read both
		  when the source is the inbuilt HTTP downloader, or if a compressed
		  file (ipfilter.dat or server.met) is explicitly moved to the .aMule
		  folder.
		* Changed C++ style comments in C sources to using C style comments.
		* Added check against trying to write NULL pointers in the CFileDataIO
		  WriteStringCore function.
		* Added some initial tests for the string reading and writing
		  functions to the CFileDataIO unittests.
		* Removed the RepeatLastAction stuff from CClientReqSocket.
		* Fixed the check for BOM-header failing on strings that were
		  3 bytes long (an empty string).
		* Fixed empty UTF8 strings with BOM headers not having the header
		  written, even though we had already written a length which
		  included the header.
		* Changed CSafeFileIO's ReadUInt128 to return an instance, which
		  simplified usage and matches the other Read-functions.
		* Added missing exception-handler to CIndexed in case of invalid tags.
		* Marked the log-event triggered when an IP was filtered as
		  non-crticial, since this event isn't critical and can be very common
		  depending on the ipfilters used.
		* Changed unittests for CFormat when empty strings were specified for
		  a field of type '%s', since some implementations of printf produced
		  different results than others, making it impossible to check against
		  those.
		* Fixed unittests for reading of UInt128 values which didn't consider
		  endianess.
		* Changed the use of Cmp to either '==' or '!=' to improve
		  readability, and simplified the sorting of the server-list when
		  sorting by name to only use the displayed name, since the special
		  cases that were being considered led to unpredictable results.
		* Fixed non-wxbase apps not terminating properly.
		* Fixed adding of comments to shared files.
		* Properly implemented a couple of functions for the remote version of
		  the DownloadQueue, which did not match the signatures of the normal
		  class.
		* Changed CMuleListCtrl's SetSortFunc to public, so that subclassing
		  isn't required in order to sort a list.
		* Dropped the "otherfunctions" namespace, since we ignored it almost
		  everywhere anyway, via the "using" keyword.
		* Updated CFileDataIO unit-tests.
		* Fixed UpdateState getting called on clients after they had been
		  deleted (in some cases) and moved the call to the CUpDownClient
		  destructor.
		* Made CTag and CPacket unassignable.
		* Renamed ReadHash16 and WriteHash16 functions of CFileDataIO, and 
		  changed them to return instances and take const references of
		  CMD4Hashes, rather deal with char*. A few other places were
		  similary changed.		  
		* Dropped the static Exists function from CFile, as it is simpler to
		  just call wxFileExists directly.
		* Removed the ability to attach/deattach file-destriptors to a CFile.
		* Merged handling of seeking in the CSafeFileIO interface.
		* Some more changes to CMemFile:
			* Making seek const and dropped resizing of the buffer if it
			  seek'd past the end.
			* Made the class uncopyable and unassignable.
			* Changed the constructor that takes an external buffer to take a
			  char* rather than a const char*, since the class allow for
			  modifications of attached buffers.
			* Removed the growth-rate from the attached-buffer constuctor, as
			  we dont make use of it and should avoid it in any case.
			* Added sanity check for the length passed to the SetLength
			  function, to avoid accepting negative values.
			* Other misc changes.
		* Removed the ability to detach a buffer from a CMemFile and the
		  accessor function that returned the current buffer. Instead, we now
		  simply use the Read function, which is equivalent of what we did
		  before in any case, but safer.
		* Unified the logging of packets received from other clients, so that
		  the type of packet received is always logged, as is the cause in
		  case of an error.
		* Fixed a couple of assertions which had the checks inverted.
		* Merged CFile and CSafeFile. Checks on reads and writes are now
		  performed in the CFileDataIO base class. The CFileIO class used in
		  kad was updated to handle this, though it currently only understands
		  EOF exceptions. This completes the majority of the changes
		  resolving around the usage of exceptions.
		* Fix compilation error that would only trigger on some versions of
		  GCC, even though the code appears to be illegal.
		* Disabled pragmas when building unittests.
		* More fixes in MuleUnit for templates.
		* Disabled logging when running unittests.
		* Changed CFileDataIO to use the new IO exception types, which allows
		  for better error handling (i.e. EOF exceptions, IO read/write
		  failures) and prepared for making use of the IO failure exceptions.
		* Reorganized, and removed some includes.
		* Fixed a couple of places that threw exceptions by pointer.
		* Moved exception handling from CServer to CServerList when loading
		  servers, which better allows for handling of invalid servers.
		* Fixed some debug-strings which were wrongly marked for translation.
		* Added IO-exception types, which will be used by CFileDataIO.
		* Moved exception handling from CFriend to CFriendList when loading
		  the list of friends, so we can stop trying to read a bad list.
		* Added missing include to MemFile.cpp
		* Changed some runtime-error checks from throwing the CInvalidPacket
		  class to instead using the MULE_VALIDATE_* checks.
		* Simplified the usage of CTags by changing the getter functions to
		  throw an exception if the function didn't match the type of the tag.
		  This allowed for the elimination of explicit checks in most places
		  where CTags are used.
		* Initialized an uninitialized variable in CContact.
		* Fixed stack-trace parsing for files with '+' in the name.
		* Improved exception handling in the CTag constructor would could leak
		  if the tag had a string name and reading the body raised an exception,
		  or if the tag was a blob and reading the body failed.
		* Added checks for code that uses the CTag class, since just assuming
		  that a tag with a specific id is of a specific type is unsafe. Also
		  changed the getter functions to return a default value should they
		  be called on a tag of the wrong type to avoid crashes in that case.
		  Finally, we no longer just ignore unknown tag-types, instead we
		  throw an exception. This is needed because we cannot determine the
		  length of the unknown tag, and thus can't skip it, making further
		  reads from the input file suspect.
		* Largely reworked the use of exceptions. Catch(...) is out, only to
		  be used when memory-leaks are to be avoided. This insures that
		  unexpected exceptions can be detected.
		* Removed an exception handler that didn't have anything to catch.
		* Changed CreateHashFromInput to use the CSafeFileIO interface and to
		  safely handle exceptions without leaking. Also removed some
		  definitions of MFC debug-macros and replaced them with wx macros.
		* Fixed the largefile-checks under windows.
		* Changed CMemFile and CFile to implemenations of the CSafeFileIO
		  interface. CSafeFile was moved to CFile.* to avoid circular
		  dependancies.
		* Dropped the CSafeMemFile which didn't provide any extra
		  functionality and instead made CMemFile derive from CSafeFile.
		* Simplified CFile a bit, in preparation for larger changes:
			* Removed the Length() function, since there is also GetLength().
			* Removed duplicate definition of seek enums.
		* Changed the checks for large-file support so that users wouldn't
		  have to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable or similar when running
		  configure.
		* Updated CIPFilter documentation.
		* Changed the ipfilter class from just asserting on invalid ranges to
		  not actually inserting them, since that would cause undefined
		  behavior.
		* Compilation-fix for Mandrake Linux.
		* Added checks against largefile support to configure.
		* Added helper-function that returns the length of a file, without
		  having to open it first.
		* Moved the loading of the ipfilter-files so that they are loaded
		  before the server.met file is loaded. This ensures that the servers
		  are filtered when start aMule.
		* Fixed some problems in MuleUnit when used with templates.
		* Fixed the CheckNewVersion function, which would crash on failure.
		* Dropped extra verbosity from CFormat's assertions, since they now
		  produce backtraces anyway.
		* Moved backtrace functions to the MuleDebug.* files and added
		  backtraces to uncaught exceptions.
		* Improved assertion-handling on shutdown and other situations.
		* Increased the verbosity of assertions in CFormat.
		* Fixed the "Is Textfile?" check which didn't handle whitespace.
		* Added support for gzipped ipfilter.dat files and added checks that
		  should ensure that we only try to parse text-files.
		* Added function for converting long-longs to strings in MuleUnit.
		* Moved some functions not part of the CFile class from the CFile.*
		  files to FileFunctions.*.
		* Fixed a bug where shared files could be added to the shared-files
		  ctrl multiple times.
		* Fixed the hasher-thread, where the wxMutexGuiLeave function was
		  called twice and improved error-checking on thread-creation. Lastly
		  moved static variables from the header, since they need not be
		  specified there.
		* Removed non-functional hack from CClientUDPSocket, which would cause
		  an infinate loop when triggered.
		* Improved handling of assertions that occur during startup.
		* When adding sources, add the source to the appropriate file first,
		  before trying to update comments and ratings availability.
		* Removed a couple of checks against 'this' being NULL.
		* Changed the handling of UDP requests for sources, so that the
		  locally connected server would be entirely skipped, instead of the
		  packets just being discarded.
		* Fixed a number of places where attempts were made to catch by
		  pointer, even though the exception was thrown by value.
		* Removed various unused variables.
		* Fixed a bug in the download queue which would result in duplicate
		  entries on the queue for local source-requests. At the moment this
		  did not result in any problems since all entries were removed from
		  the queue once sources had been requested for the file.
		* Removed the 'h' modifier from a number of format-strings where the
		  field type is 's', since that modifier does not apply to that type.
		* Simplified mule-exceptions and added more information to the
		  unhandled-exception handler.
		* Added unittests for CSimpleParser.
		* Removed the need for exception-handling in CSafeFileIO's
		  ReadOnlyString function, by allocating the buffer on the stack.
		* Fixed potential deadlock in CClientUDPSocket that could trigger when
		  an error occured during receiving.
		* Removed a number of overloaded functions from the CSafeMemFile,
		  since neither of those added any functionality. Also fixed a bug in
		  the checks against reads past the end, that checked against the
		  buffer-size rather than the (possibly smaller) file-length.
		* Marked CFile's GetLength() function as virtual.
		* Removed the unused class CSafeBufferedFile, which didn't implement
		  buffered file-IO anyway.
		* Added the ability to filter search-results. The filter select which
		  entries are displayed and supports regular-expressions. See
		  www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6.2/wx_wxresyn.html for an overview of
		  the syntax. Also added the ability to filter known files from the
		  results.
		* Added sanity checks on values read when loading settings for lists.
		* The middle mouse button now opens the details-dialog for sources and
		  files when clicking on the download-queue.
		* Fixed sort-arrows on listsctrls not being displayed after startup.
		* Set the background color of the chat textctrls to white, in order to
		  ensure that the text stays readable regardles of the theme used.
		* Largly changed the way ipfilter.dat files are handled by the
		  ipfilter class:
			* When updating the list of ip-ranges, either via the reload
			  button or the update-from-url functionality, the existing ranges
			  are dropped to allow for dropping of ranges no longer to be
			  filtered.
			* In order to allow for ip-ranges specified by the user, a second
			  file has been added (ipfilter_static.dat), which is always loaded
			  after the normal ipfilter.dat file, so that it takes precedense.
			* When either of the two ipfilter files don't exist, a template
			  file is created which contains a description of the use that
			  that file.
			* When loading zipped ipfilter files, the files are unpacked in
			  place. Doing so largely elimates the overhead compared to
			  loading normal files.
			* Moved loading of the ipfilter.dat files, so that it done after
			  the GUI has been loaded.
		* Removed the unused ExternalConnClientThread class. 
		* Merged two copies of the validateURI function in StringFunctions.*
		  and fixed a mem-leak.
		* Simplified the Update() function in the ipfilter-class, removing the
		  use of special cases when calling it.
		* Moved custom tokenizing code from the ipfilter-class to a seperate
		  class and dropped a couple of custom functions that didn't provide
		  enough of a performance boost to warrent the extra code.
		* Added unittests for the StringIPtoUint32 function, updated the
		  documentation for the function and fixed the bugs that appeared:
			* The last field was not restricted to the range 0..255.
			* Fields containing huge values could overflow to negative values
			  and would not be caught by the sanity checks.
		* Changed ASSERT_EQUALS so that descriptions only gets created in case
		  of a failed comparison, since this would otherwise result in the
		  attempted deference of end iterators and the like.
		* Moved the RLE classes to a seperate set of source files.
		* Removed probematic operator<() template function from WebServer.*,
		  and replaced it with a specialized struct. This was required since
		  the < operator would be instantiated for incorrect data-types.
		* Updated documentation for the CFormat class.
		* Dropped support for long doubles in CFormat and merged handling of
		  the other floating-point types.
		* Improved CFormat unittest, which was cluttered by serveral variables
		  with too similar names.
		* Fixed the ASSERT_EQUALS macro in MuleUnit, which would previously
		  evaluate parameters multiple times.
		* Removed the unused NeedUTF8String() function.
		* Fixed master-hash parsing for ed2klinks, which would always fail due
		  to a couple of assertions that had been badly translated into
		  exception.
		* Changed the way clients are deleted on shutdown, to help detect the
		  presence of dangling pointers caused by incorrect removals.
		* Fixed bug #494. Clients with score zero not being considered as
		  candidates for uploading.
		* Fixed a few warnings.
		* Improved handling of uncaught exceptions in the MuleUnit framework.
		* Added unittests for the CFormat class and fixed discovered errors:
			* Improved handling of string format fields.
			* Fixed a < comparison of 0 against a wxString which caused segfaults.
			* Fixed the range checking code which would fail in some cases.
			* Fixed escaped percentage signs.
			* Added the missing implementation of IsReady().
			* Improved adherence to printf as specific in 'man 3 printf'.
		* Added unittests for the CRangeMap class and fixed the errors that
		  cropped up while writing said tests:
			* The assignment operator didn't return *this.
			* The equality operator was broken. 
			* The erase function was broken.
		  Also changes ASSERTS to MULE_VALIDATE_PARAMS to enable testing and
		  ensure that the controlflow stays the same for debug and non-debug
		  builds.
		* Added a minimalistic unittesting framework called MuleUnit, which is
		  based on the EasyUnit framework (http://easyunit.sourceforge.net/).
		  The build target 'check' compiles and runs all existing unittests.
		* Fixed crash in CClientUDPSocket caused by two threads trying to send
		  and receive at the same time.
		* Removed unused Pause() function from UBT.
		* Fixed inf. loop in CClientUDPSocket, caused by poor error-handling.
		* Rewrote some poorly phrased messages.
		* Fixed uploaded data not being recorded in statistics.
		* Compilation fixes for wxGTK-2.4.2.
		* Removed the unused 'MakefileWin32' file.
		* Fixed crash in sockets that were destroyed after the UBT thread.
		* Improved source handling for known-files:
			* Fixed the possibility of source-counts getting out of sync.
			* Optimized source-removal slightly.
			* Added extra debugging checks to spot potential problems.
		* Changed access to vector of source statuses from using the []
		  operator to using the at function, to see if out-of-bounds access
		  was causing a specific crash.
		* Imported the UploadBandwidthThrottler from eMule, which should help
		  ensure that upload-limits are more closely followed.

	Special Thanks To:
		* All the translaters who did such a great and fast job.

			- aMule version on webserver's Statistics page
		* Endianness fixes in EC.
		* Fixed appearing strange characters at the end of webserver's
		  log and debug log pages.
		* Fixed logo.jpg being not installed.
		* Webserver graphs are now resizable and rescalable.
		* Removed some unneeded code/data from daemon.
		* Added gcc #pragmas to reduce executable size.
		* Several improvements on EC network code:
			- EC now uses buffered I/O, so most EC transmissions will only
			  require one socket operation.
			- Added the ability to compress large packets with zlib, thus
			  reducing network load.
			- Some (not-so-CPU-consuming) compression is applied to small
			  packets, too.
		* A number of i18n fixes, mostly changing debug messages to be

		* Speed Bar color (on the new wxTray) is setted in the statistics color selection 
		  (as old GTK tray!)
		* Some configure checks and cleanup

	Kry:
		- Global -
		* We're now fully compatible with the ed2k Unicode implementation, allowing Unicode searches,
		   comments, usernames, file names, ...
		   This works both for unicode-aware servers and clients.
		* New SysTray code using wxWidgets' wxTaskBarIcon with several hacks for making it
		   properly transparent while keeping the nice download speed bar. Multiplatform, also.
		   Activated by default on > wx2.5.3
		* Corrected a nice mistake where wxSOCKET_LOST was identified as error.
		* Fixed clasic systray code to support unicode names properly.
		* Removed/Cleaned/etc header includes.
		* Fixed unicode bug on wxOpen preventing to share some files.
		* Fixed the SERVER_IDENT packet processing.
		* Auto-sort code for list controls. Disabled by default, too much flickering on mac and gtk2.

		* Fixed unhandled exception from server TCP socket.
		* Fixed lowid clients callback.
		* Fixed duplicated floating point functions being called every second (CPU improvement).
		* New file is added: tree.hh, credits to Kasper Peeters, <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>
		   It's a stl-like tree and I really enjoyed coding with it. 
		   More info on http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/kp229/tree/
		* Fixed a crash on Proxy code created by bad string initialization causing mem corruption.
		* Added wxProxyData::Empty() to properly clean aMule proxy data when needed.

		* Fixed the CUpDownClient::SendFileRequest crash you were all screaming about on rc8 :P
		* Fixed SUI failures with kernels >= 2.6.10. This failures and asserts were created by the locking 
		  of /dev/urandom that was introduced on 2.6.10, and that made CryptoPP fail on creating a random
		  pool for the SUI identification. This is more a workaround actually than a fix, but will work perfectly.
		* Completed files now go to shared as the should.
		* Fixed search on localised languages.
		* UDP disable is working properly now.
		* Close the UDP socket if we're not listening anymore.

		* Fixed the crash on non-std locales because of date/time functions.
		* Get rid of more ugly unicode2char stuff by making the logfile a wxFFileOutputStream.
		* General speedup of log file.
		* Proper order of files on Makefile.am, much better to know compilation progress by first letter.		
		* Moved at last all stats to where they belong: the new files Statistics.cpp and Statistics.h.
		* Fixed assert on client list view caused by unknown client state.
		* Hopefully avoid the never-deleted sockets (passive sources)

		* Fixed memleak on ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Fixed the "Invalid UTF8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()" messages on GTK2 builds.

		* Fixed serious memleak on tag code for packets. And I mean serious.
		* Removed the unused UTF82char function.
		* Fixed queue limits on upload queue (off-by-one bug).
		* Fixed hash for files with size (n*PARTSIZE).
		* Fixed compilation for systems where zlib is not linked by default.
		* Fixed OP_SENDINGPART to actually be a edonkey protocol and not emule protocol packet.
		* Fixed memleak on AICH thread.
		* Fixed several memleaks on ed2k links handling.
		* Fixed threads not being closed properly, specially the global search one.
		* Fixed serious memleak on client UDP reask
		* Don't remove the server because of failedcount if it's static.
		* When the user tries to remove a static server, we prompt for confirmation.
		* Files on non-ansi named folders are no longer rehashed on every restart.
		* Don't discard UDP packets on wxSOCKET_WOULDBLOCK. This improves UDP socket 
		  reliability a lot. Remove the packet from queue if sent, keep it if it's not sent because of wouldblock,
		  and drop it on any other error.
		* Send previously queued UDP packets before we send a new UDP packet.
		* Fixed aMule crashing on second global search under certain circunstances.
		* Fixed the hanging on connecting to server.

		* Fixed last (I hope!) endianness bug with IPFilter
		* Fixed a major endianness bug with widespread effects.  On Mac,

		  list; server pings work.  Global search seems to work better.
		  DNS lookup of servers and ED2K link sources should now work.
		* Enabled support for ed2k links in web browsers for Mac
		  (although idiosyncracies of common browsers prevent it from
		  being as transparent as one would like).

		wxHTTP.

	Stefanero:
		* Work on the Man-Pages
		* Minor compile fixes
		* Lots of support and testing

	stsp:
		* Compilation fix for STL enabled wxWidgets.

	volpol:
		* Patch to fix use of deprecated functions in wxGTK-2.5.3.

	Vollstrecker:
		* Initial and further work on aMule and utils' man pages.

	Xaignar:
		* Improved logging for CFile, getting rid of the annoying
		  pop-up windows which were previously displayed.
		* Workaround for fonts getting changed on the log-view 
		  when the clear-button was pressed (wxMac specific).
		* Work on getting aMule ready for win32, including fixing
		  the custom-drawing for listctrls.
		* Fixed threading issues with the UDP-sockets in daemon-
		  mode, which were the cause of a number of crashes.
		* Made the preferences dialog modal to fix problems where
		  it would be displayed at bad locations.
		* Ensured that the Banned-Count would be initialized to zero
		  rather than display a random value until it gets properly 
		  set (not yet implemented).
		* Improved the "aMule has crashed" message, adding some
		  more information and fixed the backtrace to skip unneeded
		  frames properly.
		* Fixed some static text-ctrls not properly expanding, so
		  that some text would be cut off the end.
		* Fixed some position bugs in the progress-bar drawing and 
		  addeed a black border. A4AF sources now displays that text
		  instead of an empty area.
		* Moved the placement of the "Initializing aMule" message on
		  startup so that --version will only result in the version
		  information and ensured that amule wont start in case an 
		  invalid commands was given, instead printing the help info.
		* Fixed problems with selection on the clients-list.
		* Improved usage of compressed packets. Now only files that are
		  not in the list of known archive-formats are compressed, rather
		  than just Zip, Rar and Ace.
		* Improved error-handling when opening ports. If either the 
		  EC or Server-UDP ports conflict with the other ports, then
		  a random safe value is selected in the range 1025 ... 2^16-1.
		* Fixed shared files being located twice during startup, which
		  also resulted in the AICH thread being run twice.
		* Fixed logging to stdout containing extra newlines.
		* Cleaned up and merged a number of split translated strings,
		  which should make it easier for translaters to work.
		* Fixed some status changes not resulting in removal from or
		  addition to filtered download categories.
		* Improved handling of multi-line log events on the main dialog.
		* Reduced the ammount of output to the console, changing printfs
		  to either normal or debug log events.
		* Escape-codes in ED2k links are now properly unescaped.
		* Cleaned up and improved the readability of the clients-details dialog.
		* Updated the modified listctrl widget used by aMule, so that
		  wxWidgets 2.4.x and 2.5.x will use a modified version from 
		  that branch rather than a more generic hacked version. For one
		  thing, the headers are now drawn using the current GTK theme.
		* Properly handle rehashing of empty part-files.
		* Changed the "Filter Bad IPs" option to "Filter LAN IPs". Invalid
		  IPs will always be filtered, but LAN IPs will now only be filtered
		  if the option is enabled.
		* Added back-traces to asserts, in order to help debugging efforts.
		* Made usage of wxASSERT thread-safe.
		* Attempted to fix some longstanding problems with the notebooks.
		* Removed unused files: Preview.h and Preview.cpp
		* Updated, cleaned and unified license-headers for all aMule 
		  related source files.
		* Improved the error-message displayed when a server couldn't
		  be added, so that it is clear as to why it couldn't be added.
		* Avoid flooding the console when searching for filetypes,
		  mismatches are now logged as debugloglines instead.
		* The "Clear" button on the search page now also clears the
		  search text.
		* Better handling of multi-line chat messages: The complete
		  message will be split by linebreaks and each line timestamped.
		* Fixed entries for connected servers in server-list not being
		  completly reverted to normal after disconnection.
		* Added handling of SIGINT and SIGTERM for gracefull shutdowns.
		* Renamed the config file from ~/.eMule to ~/.aMule/amule.conf.
		  The old file will not be removed, in order to allow backwards
		  compatibility.
		* aMule now automatically removes unavailable files from the 
		  list of shared files.
		* Fixed right-clicking not selecting the tab being clicked on.
		* Fixed casts to pointers of higher alignment where it could
		  cause allignment crashes on SPARC, created general function
		  for doing this safely both SPARC and non-SPARC machinces.
		* Added a typesafe replacement for printf, designed with 
		  inspiration from the format class in the boost library.
		* Improved logging capabilities. It is now possible to enable/
		  disable debugging output by category. All existing debug 
		  calls where changed to support this. This can be controlled
		  in the preference dialog.
		* Fixed some problems with the connect dialog for remote gui.
		* Some pass-by-value fixes.
		* Moving de-initialization code from the CamuleApp destructor
		  to OnExit. This insures that the app-object would be valid
		  while the shutdown is in progress.
		* Moved deinialization code from OnRun in amuled to OnExit in
		  order to ensure that it was also run on premature exits.
		* Made safe connection-rate calculations the default behavior,
		  which should help avoid too fast connections.
		* Add class for keeping track of unusable sources, based on
		  the same class in eMule. This should reduce the ammounts
		  of connections made since bad sources are not re-asked too
		  often.
		* Fixed servers with IP 0.0.0.0 being added to serverlist.
		* Fix to IP-range parser in CIPFilter. Incorrect range in the
		  form "a.b.c.d-e.f.g." would not be caught.
		* Misc cleanups in CServerList.
		* Fixed creation of online-sig files.
		* Made DownloadQueue and ServerList observables.
		* Added a Observer/Observable implementation. This was needed
		  to implement a queue that would be kept in sync with another
		  queue thus allowing thread-safe delayed iteration over a list.
		* Fixed crash in search-list, where the search-packet would be
		  deleted twice.
		* Removed the usage of "ED2KServers" file, as the download-queue
		  now takes care of handling all types of ed2k-links.
		* Rewrote 'ed2k' utility in c++ and fixed support for extra
		  information appended to ed2k links.
		* Merged IP-check functions and moved it to NetworkFunctions.*.
		* Fixed usage of uninitialized variables in CPartFile constructor.
		* Removing unsused functions from CServerList.
		* Removed unused CArray.h file.
		* Fixed pontial wrong tag-count in server.met writing, which
		  would result in a corrupt file.
		* Disabled connection-try code, due to inherent problems with it.
		* Reworked the CDownloadQueue class.
		* Fixed creation of ED2K links for servers.
		* Removed the need for seperate AICH hashings of completing files.
		  Instead both AICH hashsets and MD4 hashes are created during
		  completion, and the AICH is simply discarded if corruptions are
		  found. This however is rare, and thus doing both at the same time
		  results in less time spent hashing.
		* Improved upon the "requested file not found" log-message, which
		  would happen when a client requested the hashset for an unknown
		  file.
		* Reworked the checks for free disk-space, should behave much
		  more consistantly now.
		* Fixed files being hashed twice, once when completed and again
		  after aMule had been restarted.
		* Make use of native GTK2 popup menu for text-ctrls when possible.
		* Disabled aMule on systems where wxGTK is older than version
		  2.5.1 and is compiled against GTK2. The big honking warning
		  in the log proved to be useless, but this should work ...
		* Added helper-function to of.h for removing values from a stl-list.
		* Fixed usage of windows font-type "Arial" in statistics-dialog.
		* Fixed logging of filtered IPs. Only 2 of four cases were logged.
		* Disallow External Connections if no valid password has been set.
		* Fixed both sources and files getting shown for the file-count
		  in the transfer dialog.
		* Added date to version-information for CVS snapshots.
		* Reworked CBarShader, making it use the CRangeMap class and getting
		  rid of needless floating-point math. This fixes some problems where
		  large chunks would be drawn as complete, even though only a small
		  part of the file was complete.
		* Fixed downloads being assigned to the default category despite
		  the extended options being disabled in search dialog.
		* Moved overhead calculations to the CStatistics class.
		* Removed enabling/disabling of the clear-downloads buttons. The
		  checks touched far too much code without adding much.
		* Moved StripInvalidFilenameChars from CamuleApp to StringFunctions
		  and renamed it to CleanupFilename.
		* Fixed pending file-blocks not being properly removed when
		  client-objects were destroyed, resulting in parts of files
		  that could not be downloaded until aMule had been restarted.
		* Fixed re-filtering of sources when IP-filter level had been
		  changed in the preferences.
		* Reworked CIPFilter class:
		  * Huge improvements in loading-speeds (~6x).
		  * Added support for loading zipped files.
		  * Switched to using the CRangeMap class.
		* Added CRangeMap class, which is a map with two keys, an
		  start and an end key, with a single value attached. This
		  was previously duplicated serveral places.
		* Fixed problems with deleting multiple items on serverlist.
		* Misc code-cleanups.
		* Added the ability to delete servers using the delete-key.
		* Fixed sorting by the "Transfered down" field on client-list.
		* Added ruby-script for detecting common issues.
		* More work on properly marking getter function const.
		* Reworked the CDownloadListCtrl class.
		* Added overloaded versions of CmpAny functions for strings.
		* Reduced memory usage of IP-ranges in CIPfiler by removing
		  redundant information.
		* Fixed extremly non-optimal function in CDownloadQueue which
		  was used many places. Could locate item in vector through 
		  counting of iterator increments.
		* Fixed pre-shutdown message to something more closely reflecting
		  the actual events taking place.
		* Collected common "Data To Human-Readable" functions in file-set.
		* Reworked the ED2K-link classes.
		* Reworked handling of ED2K links, making behavior consistant
		  everywhere and fixing support for |serverlist| URLs.
		* Changed time-span of overhead calculations from 5s to 15s.
		* Removed redundant message displayed when files were added to a
		  a non-connected mule.
		* Added missing Add-Overhead calls for various packets.
		* Fixed a mem-leak in CFileDataIO::WriteString.
		* Fixed compilation of Proxy with wxGTK-2.4.2.
		* Changed default configure options. Now only 'amule' and 'ed2k' are
		  compiled by default, since other apps require extra dependancies.

	xmb:
		* id2ip awk script (with Jacobo221)

		   that filehash. Needs browser correctly configured on preferences.
		* Implemented messages filtering, from know clients/bogus clients/by words.

		* Changed m4/readline.m4 so that readline libs are only used
		  when needed, i.e., no longer append readline libs to LIBS,
		  use READLINE_LIBS instead.
		* Fixed crash in aMule when amuleweb tried to get transfers
		  tab and aMule had never connected to a server before.
		* New backtrace output with demangled function names, file
		  names and line numbers, when possible.
		* Initial (not functional yet) SOCKS5 proxy support.
		* Initial (not functional yet) SOCKS4 proxy support.
		* Initial (not functional yet) HTTP proxy support.
		* Updated some tests in configure.in.
		* Fixed a problem with _() usage. Static string initialization

		* Fixed a bug in WebServer.cpp:CWebServer::GetStatusBox():
		  return value was missing end tags.
		* Changed back to macro the inline function version of
		  unicode2char() when using UNICODE. Unfortunately, when the

	lfroen:
		* Moving amuleweb to EC version 2.0
		* Fixes on amuleweb socket code
		* Added generated png images to amuleweb
		* Added RLE encoder for gap and parts status to EC
		* Fixes in amule daemon

	Madcat:

	GonoszTopi:
		* Initial work on EC protocol version 2.0.
		* Fixed a crash on broken language files (.po)
		* Some GUI cosmetics.
		* Lots of i18n fixes.
		* As a side effect, fixed the "Any" search in webserver.

		* Tracked down and killed a number of hidden bugs.
		* Added commands to change/monitor bandwidth settings to
		  amulecmd.
		* Made wxTRANSLATE actually work.
		* Fixed graphs in webserver. Also added the missing back.gif file.
		* Fixed buffer overflow problem in ed2k link handler.
		* Stats bug fixed.

	wizeman:
		* Helped finding the code snippet where WebSocket was failing on request.
		* Fixed 'Safe Max connections' code. It's safer to use it now, and it works.
		* Fixed bug where amule would start consuming 100% cpu when it received a 
		  corrupted EC packet.
		* Fixed webserver, it wouldn't close connection when it received a POST request.
		* Fixed webserver crash: added mutex to make variable wcThreads thread-safe.
		* Fixed webserver <-> amule communication corruption when the webserver 
		  received simultaneous requests. The problem was that all webserver threads 
		  were using the same socket for sending/receiving EC packets to/from amule 
		  without synchronization.

	Xaignar:
		* Added the new casting macros to otherfunctions.
		* Added a helper-function to CMuleListCtrl for use in the Sorter functions.
		* Fixed the priority-column on Server List.

		* Fixed two crashes on ClientList.
		* Fixed compilation for solaris on several places.
		* Make sure that clients cant just crash us by sending a aich-request for an invalid hash.
		* Fixed a couple of sub-menues.
		* Removed the leech-mod checks, they were getted outdated anyway
		* Fixed open sockets count.
		* Avoid re-layouting the entire dlg when updating some labels.
		* Small fix to CMuleNoteBook.
		* Adding a missing event-handler en shared files tab.
		* Changed the primary hashing thread to do both MD4 and AICH hashing for non-part files.
		  This cut down hashing of ~2.8gb of data from ~12:40 minutes to ~7 minutes on tests.
		* Adding checks against the user sharing the following dirs: Home-dir, .aMule, Temp-dir.
		  Sharing home is allowed but results in a warning.
		* Fixed the Upload-parts drawing.
		* Fixed sorting by filename on the Uploading list.
		* Fixed crash on server list auto-update. Removes the possibility of overrunning a array.
		* Optimization of UpdatePartsInfo, which now no longer needs to traverse the parts-info 
		  arrays of each source for that file.
		* Fixed the redraw problems where some things wouldn't be erased on list controls.
		* Code cleaning, documenting and rewrite.

Version 2.0.0rc7 - The "99,6% Final" version.
----------
2004-10-19

	bisley:
		* Added session ratio and total ratio to XAS

	deltaHF:
	        * Got back from hell and changed one icon on the GUI ;)

	Jacobo221:
		aMule GUI:
		* Fixed two almost-the-same bugs when clicked download button 
		  and no items where selected (as reported by powtrix/willy,
		  thanks).

		aMuleWeb:
		* Fixed a bug where up/down limits woudln't be displayed 
		  correctly if their string length were different.

		aMuleCMD:
		* Added 'list' (or 'find') command to search for a file in
		  the downloads queue by name or by number (or just show all).
		* Added the ability to resume/pause all downloads at the same 
		  time through amulecmd (very handy when all downloads have
		  been paused due to lack of space).
		* Fixed two bugs on amulecmd by which using 'pause' or 'resume'
		  without arguments would pause/resume the oldest download.
		* Fixed a bug so that help command no longer is send to core.
		* Fixed other commands sending blank data to core.
		* Cleaned unneeded output log messages + added sent command
		  messages to log (for easier security monitoring).
		* Several command simplifications on amulecmd to make it easier
		  to use (while maintaining backwards compatibility).
		* Lots of translations lacks

	KingFish:
		* Fixed broken compilation in SysTray.cpp with gcc 3.3.4.

	Kry:
		* Fixed: 	Crashes related to animation deletion on http download dialog
		* Fixed: 	0-size server.met file crashing aMule on startup and on download.
		* Fixed:	GUI blocking on server connection.
		* Fixed: 	The last (hopefully) "fixed minsize" bug. FileDetail dialog was growing :)
		* Misc code cleaning.
		* Mac: 
			* Enabling wxCocoa compilation
			* Fixed: 	Secure Ident was not working on big endian archs.
			* Fixed: 	ClientID endianess issues leading to faking low/high id
			* Fixed: 	Several fields were not having correct size on preferences.
			* Fixed: 	Curl preform_multi was crashing the http download dialog on Mac.
					This means server.met update and ipfilter update was crashing.
					Currently the fix disables 'Cancel' button on that dialog, while we
					wait for curl lib to fix this issue.
		
	lfroen:
	        * Removed debug printf's in timer.cpp.
		* Fix for deadlock on connection timeout in ServerSocket.cpp.
		* Fixed assert when build with wx-cvs.
		* Added option for disabling SIGSEG handling: useful for
		  debuging in amuled.cpp.
		* EMSocket.h cleanup.
		* Fixed unclosed sockets (CLOSE_WAIT) and few stability
		  problems.
		* Make CEMSocket::OnReceive thread safe. MAX_SIZE reduced,
		  cause even theoretically tcp can buffer up to 64K.
		* amuled fixes.

	mfs:
		* Fixed crashes on friendlist when keeping keys pressed
		* Fixed one server not being removed when several servers selected
		* Fixed access problems on deleting the ipfilter while accessing it

	Phoenix:
		* Fixed '&' char next to Preferences in amuleweb web page, as
		  reported by DreamWalker.
		* ExternalConn: protected GETCATTITLE command from buffer
		  overflow.
		* Start removing unused code from ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Fixed high CPU usage problem in amuleweb, thanks to jaguarwan for
		  the report. Daemonizing amuleweb should be done using the -q
		  switch.

	ThePolish:
		* Implemented new hits system in wxCas to display and save download rate records.
		* Changed wxCas layout to try to avoid display bug with wx-cvs
		* Added translations update (Thanks to all translators)
		* Removed wxCas documentation to slim source tree (now downloadable from berlios)

	Seagull:
		* Patch adding "Directory" column to the shared-files dialog.
		* Patch to add "Swap to this file" option for sources marked as 
		  "Asked For Another File" on download queue.

	Unleashed:
		* Better fix for amuleweb's high CPU usage problem. Now main thread only gets
		  woken up when absolutely needed.

	Xaignar:
		* Reinsured that the preferences will be saved upon clicking "Ok".
		* Removed SSE2 specific optimizations from the embedded Crypto++ sources,
		  they would break very easily and crash aMule.
		* Fixed a bug where we would sometimes attempt to remove a client 
		  from the wrong file, resulting in dangling pointers and crashes.
		* Ensured that the statistics-dialog would be updated when preferences
		  relating to it where changed.
		* Added sanity checks to category-loading, to avoid adding categories
		  without incomming dir or name.
		* Initial fix for crashes if aMule tried to share an inaccessible folder.
		* The redraw problems on restoring from minimized state should be fixed.
		* Fixed the shared-files list, which would draw columns regardless 
		  of whenever or not they were hidden.
		* Fixed the progress-bars in the shared-files dialog. It should now
		  work properly for both part and completed files.
		* Fixed a bug in the ipfilter, where non-numeric chars on lines would
		  cause wrong ranges of IPs to be filtered.
		* Re-added the priority menu for servers, which had gone missing due
		  to a mistake.
		* Stopped the client-credits class from attempting to load older 
		  versions of the lists, which again would lead to mem-corruption.
		* Fixed hidden columns on download queue, which would still be drawn.
		* Added sanity checks to loading of clients.met file, since corrupted 
		  files would lead to potentially huge ammounts of mem-corruption.
		* Added "Completed Sources" column to the shared-files dialog.
		* Fixed a bug in sockets where disconnected sockets wouldn't be removed
		  immediatly, but left to timeout instead.
		* Fixed an end-less loop on the AICH thread if a file on the queue
		  was removed from the list of shared files.
		* Fixed an end-less loop when changing file-status by category.
		* Fixed the auto-priority menu-item on the download list when multiple items
		  where selected. It would un-set auto-priotity instead.
		* A bit of optimization in CPartFile. More work will follow later.
		* Properly initialized a number of variables.
		* Fixed the column-width saving/loading which I managed to break shortly before 
		  rc6 was release. Whoops. :p
		* Ampersands will no longer be doubled when lines are added to the log-view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	
Version 2.0.0rc6 - The "We're so EVIL that we make you lose a sock in every pair" version.
----------
2004-10-03
	
	deltaHF:
		* GUI for MyInfo at Server window.
		* Added 'About' button.
		* Fixed sorting upload list by speed
		* Changed the Search dialog. 
		* Fixes websearch for jugle.net
		* Added hability for send msg to clients in upload queue, without having to add 
		  them as friends (based on Kry's download queue send-on-right-click implementation)
		* Translations update.

	falso:
		* New upstream cas version. Now supports creating html pages with the statistics
		* Now cas runs on netbsd.
		* Misc fixes on cas.

	GonoszTopi:
		* Patch to fix buffer overflow in cas when line had more than
		  80 chars.
		* Patch to fix help switch in ExternalConnector.cpp
		* Patch to create -c switch in amulecmd: now the command line
		  version can connect, execute a command and exit.

	Hetfield:
		* Lots of 3.4.x compilation fixes, due to -DWX_PRECOMP
		  and wx headers checks.
		* Configure cleanup, safetray remove and nice cosmetics for tools
		* Configure option added: --enable-embedded_crypto to use amule crypto code
		and bypass crypto libs. Also fix freeze problem.
		* fixed crypto usage in core with configure and compilation flags
		* Re-enable Pentium4 and SSE2 optimizations fro Crypto stuff

	Jacobo221:
		* Fixed issue on the About button.

	Kry:
		* Got back from hell.
		* Imported eMule's 0.44x new corruption handling: AICH
		   AICH stands for Advanced Inteligent Corruption Handling, and avoid having to 
		   re-download a full part everytime we get corruption on a file. With AICH, you will
		   just re-download the 184Kb block that has corruption. It uses HashTrees to achieve 
		   the corruption diagnosis. 
		   More info: http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/help.cgi?l=1&rm=show_topic&topic_id=589
		   *********************************************************************************
		   WARNING: AICH thread will re-hash all your files on your first rc6 startup. This can 
		   take very long when the user has lots of shared files. We're sorry but that's the only 
		   way to build the HashTree and thus making AICH able to work.
		   *********************************************************************************
		* Fixed the AICH implementation to support big endian archs (like ppc).
		* Implemented IPfilter auto-load on startup
		* Implemented IPFilter 'Update Now' button on preferences.
		* Revamped the HTTP download dialog, used to download IPfilter and server.met 
		   (and probably other files in a near future) Now it's the thread who runs the dialog,
		   and dialog no longer block aMule while loading. It also has a progress bar. Yay!
		* Fixed amule daemon not allowing auto-dowload of server.met.
		* First rework of the Search dialog, later re-worked by Xaignar using the 
		  hide/show engine I did.
		* Implemented "Send messages" via right-click on source.
		* When aMule is running and you try to run a second aMule, it now send a 
		   'raise' message to the current runing one. This is designed to fix the problems
		   with aMule being in a inexistant systray and thus people being unable to recover it.
		* Fixed documentation:
			* Bugs on  kb/kB mistakes
			* Added "What are all those fancy colors in the download progress bar about?"
		* --version switch now returns 0 (sucessfull app termination)
		* MOD_VERSION_LONG does no longer show 2.0.0 version on CVS
		* Cleaned the GUI for LOTS of unnecessary wxSizers that were looking ugly on Mac
		   and making wxDesigner project file much cleaner.
		* Fixed memleaks on curl usage (thanks Seagull)
		* Systray is now skinnable
		* Safety checks: A File can't have more than 441 partcount
		* Added a file-access tracker that allowed us to fix lot of file access bugs:
			* We were closing invalid file descriptors!
			* Random Error responese from CFile class, again
			* Misc multiple bugs that made me kinnda rewrite the class
		* Fixed user not being notified of duplicated files on shareds
		* Safe load for clients.met (no more removing to load amule)
		* Fixed PrefsUnifiedDlg using wrong events for Spin controls.
		* Search textbox now accepts enter key (did it work before? or never worked?)
		* aMule now compiles and works with wxWidgets 2.5.2, with no gui bugs
		* Fixed a nasty cvs bug that was just taking '0' on upload settings as 0, not unlimited.
		* Fixed CArray implementation to avoid ints and make usage of size_t and off_t
		* Added GetConnectIP() implementation to BaseClient so we can hold the supposed IP 
		   or (after we had a connection) the real IP
		* Implemented extra-file_corruption_safety on files. No more 'please rm -rf .aMule/'
		* Implemented safe recover of .part.met files.
		   This means that if a .part.met file gets corrupted, aMule will take care of it and try 
		   to recover it with minimal info. As a matter of fact, only filesize and hash is need,
		   so any other info will be recovered or set to default instead of discarding the part file.
		* Fixed mem corruption on BaseClient
		* Fixed a crash on UploadListCtrl due to access to a either uninitialised or removed client.
		* Fixed the annoying empty message being sent every time a client connects to us while 
		  we have a chatwindow with him. this was really pissing people off ;)
		* Reworked SafeFile.cpp and made it compatible with eMule 0.44x. 
		* aMule defaults to maximize if not size not overriden and no gui size stored (robably first run)
		* Implemented CDirIterator. 
		   Used to get rid of wxFindFirstFile and such buggy functions (breaking filenames on Mac and others). 
		* Added GUI preferences fo AICH's hash trusting and IPfilter new options.
		* Corrected xMule version show. xMule started sending correct version tags on 1.9.1b, only 4
		   months after I told them, and only 1 after eMule+ developers did. Is based on our implementation
		   (x.y.z instead of eMule's x.ya), so it was not hard to show them correctly ;)
		* Misc developing, memleak fixing, code rewrite, and co-workers abuse by insulting 
		   them and degrading them to worm state.
		
		* Kademlia Import:
			kademlia/utils
			* UInt128.cpp (class for handling 128-bits integers, added hability to read/write on SafeFile).
			* UInt128.h
			* All other files on the kademlia/utils are not needed by aMule.
			kademlia/kademlia/
			* Defines.h
			* Entries.h
			* Error.h
			* Tag.h
			kademlia/routing/
			* Map.h

		* Mac:
			* Fixed compilation near every day :)
			* Fixed the file descriptor problems, using the new file access tracker.
			* Fixed the clients.met file being saved badly and thus breaking load.
			* Fixed Search page not setting the SearchType to default.
			* Fixed the start, clear and clear all buttons on Search page
			* Fixed wrong usage (at least on Mac) of multi line control functions on single line text control
			* Fixed sharing dirs giving access errors (and probably on other archs than Mac).
			* Fixed amule daemon for taking 100% (or 198% on a dual system) CPU.
			* Fixed wrong filenames being shown when more than 24 chars. See CDirIterator above.
			* Fixed 'MyInfo' tab showing wrong endianess on IP.
			
		* Deleted files:
			eMule-Import-Status	-> Very old unused file.
			RC1-KnownBugs	-> Very old unused file.
			HTTPDownloadDlg.*	-> HTTPDownload.* (no longer a GUI file)
			

	lfroen:
		* Core/GUI separation:
			* Moved all GUI code out of Core files.
			* Made a new socket engine to be able to use wxSocket on wxBase, even when
			   wxBase has no event pool.
			* aMule daemon is now functional,  but it still need hard testing.
			   Enable it using --enable-amule-daemon.
			   You can control it via any EC app (amulecmd, amuleweb)
			* aMule separated GUI does not compile right now, and the communication
			   with the core will be improved as EC is rewritten by GonoszTopi.
		* Fixed crash on DownloadClient
		* Misc aMule fixes here and there :)
			
	Littletux:
		* Patch to include UTF-8 support in systray.
		* Patch to fix configure.in UTF-8 SysTray code.

	Phoenix:
		* Fixed a compilation warning + appartently useless code in 
		  DirectoryTree.cpp.
		* Fixed amuleIPV4Address for wx-2.5.2 and up.
		* Fixed the low number of sources problem with wx-2.5.2 and
		  up. Problem was in CUDPSocket::SendBuffer, now there is a
		  macro to test. aMule should be 2.5.2 network ready now.
		* wxCHECK_VERSION(2,5,0) no longer necessary in
		  amule{web,cmd} for wxApp because we have now -DwxUSE_GUI=0.
		* New command line parameter in amulecmd: -pw or --password.
		* New commands in amulecmd: serverconnect, reloadipf and
		  setipfilter. Thanks rommel for the initial patch.
		* Fixed amulecmd command parser. Help was not coherent and
		  giving syntar errors.
		* Rewrote command parser/processor im amulecmd to use
		  wxStrings.
		* Some i18n stuff in amulecmd.
		* Rewrote amulecmd and amuleweb, creating a new module,
		  ExternalConnector.cpp. This module has a lot of code
		  common to both programs, and will make it easier to
		  maintain.
		* Fixed a small wxString bug in CamuleDlg::AddLogLine() 
		  in amuleDlg.cpp.
		* Improoved wxSting usage in ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Yielding in DownloadQueue.cpp Init() so that gui is not 
		  blank when loading lots of files.
		* A little better font/color handling in amulewebDLG and 
		  amulecmdDLG.
		* New command line parameter for amuleweb, amulewebDLG,
		  amulecmd and amulecmdDLG: -f. This parameter reads the
		  ECPpassword and the ECPort from the [ExternalConnect]
		  section of file ~/.eMule. This way, the plain text password
		  doesn't have to be passed in the command line.
		* Updated socket-2.5.c to the latest wx-cvs code. 
		  Fast reconnect -> lowid bug is fixed in wx-cvs now. When
		  wx-2.5.3 is out, we will finally be able to drop this file.
		  It will only be needed for versions 2.5.0(?) to 2.5.2.
		* Removed gsocket-2.5.h from the project. This file was not
		  beeing used anymore.
		* Added command line parameter "-q" or "--quiet" to
		  amuleweb(Dlg) and amulecmd(Dlg). This is to run amuleweb
		  without any output to stdout, so that it does not need a
		  terminal.
		* Changed amulewebDLG and amulecmdDLG to use sizers.
		* Removed a bug in WebSocket.cpp: was not testing the return
		  value of Accept, this could create a thread with a NULL socket.
		* Added two new commands to amulecmd(DLG), GetIPLevel and
		  SetIPLevel <new level>.
		* Rewrote most of the wxString usage of amule web server in
		  ExternalConn.cpp. There should be some speed improovement.
		* Removed pop up when web server requested ed2k source link
		  and amule was low id.
		* Fixed a problem with Server Connect command in amulecmd, it
		  was not working. It has been renamed to ConnectTo. Also
		  fixed help command output, should look better now.
		* Added "-fmessage-length=0 -W" flags when --enable-debug.
		* Changed m4/wxwin.m4 to recognize wx-config --libs base (no
		  equal sign from 2.5.3 and up).
		* Unicode fix in SysTray and new compiler wanings fix due to
		  new compiler debug option -W.
		* Some more consts in code due to CDownloadQueue::GetFileByIndex()
		  and CSharedFileList::GetFileByIndex(). Also cleaned those
		  functions.
		* Fixed Resume/Pause bug in amulecmd/amule. Now Resume/Pause
		  argument starts at zero.
		* More gsocket.h update.
		* Debug protocol options. Comment/Uncomment:
		    #define DEBUG_LOCAL_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in BaseClient.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_REMOTE_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in ListenSocket.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_SERVER_PROTOCOL in ServerSocket.cpp
		    #define DEBUG_CLIENT_PROTOCOL in sockets.cpp
		* Changed configure.in to no longer use gsocket-2.5.c for 
		  wx-2.5.3 and up.
		* Fixed the Random Lowid Bug.
		* Cleaner solution to RLB: Accept() the connection and
		  Destroy() the socket immediately.
		* Fixed a lot of bugs in amuleweb. In particular, stop / pause
		  / cancel / priority(up/down) now works.
		* Removed bubble sort code in download queue from amuleweb.
		  This code did not scale for large number of files, like
		  hundreds. There is still room for improovement here.
		* Fixed a bug in SafeFile.cpp. wxString.Length() returns the
		  number of codes in the string, which is less than or equal
		  to the number of bytes in a multibyte encoded string. This way, 
		  amule will also not crash with locale search strings like korean,
		  japanese and chinese.
		* Several amuleweb/ExternalConn bug fixes. Now the
		  communication is in UTF8, so that soon amuleweb non-unicode can 
		  communicate with amule unicode and vice-versa. There was a
		  bug when the number of files was more than approximately 90
		  because the communication routines could not handle strings
		  greater than 64K chars. There is still some replicated code
		  in ExternalConn.cpp, but the idea is that it will use the
		  code in ECSocket.cpp.
		* Bug fix in ExternalConn.cpp. ECSocket must have the
		  wxSOCKET_WAITALL flag to work properly when the message has
		  more than 64Kbytes. aMule now uses ECSocket.cpp, no more
		  replicated code in ExternalConn.cpp.
		* Fixed a bug in ListenSocket.cpp, m_client can be null after
		  ProcessSecIdentStatePacket(), so, we must check.
		* Fixed conversion problems in ECSocket.cpp. Now external
		  connections in UTF-8 are really working, and
		  amuleweb/amulecmd (unicoded or not) can connect to amule
		  (unicoded or not).
		* Fixed an unprotected call to strlen() in ECSockets.cpp, if 
		  you pass a NULL pointer to it, the program segfaults.
		* Added a timer for idle repainting in amulewebDLG and
		  amulecmdDLG.
		* Fixed this assertion in Preferences.cpp: [Debug] 07:02:00 AM: 
		  include/wx/longlong.h(155): assert "(m_ll >= LONG_MIN) && 
		  (m_ll <= LONG_MAX)" failed: wxLongLong to long conversion
		  loss of precision.
		* Reimplemented "Show Rates On Title" preference.
		* Initial import of new MD4 hash code from emule 0.44a into
		  KnownFile.{cpp,h}.
		* Removed amuleweb html template 12 char password limitation.
		* Small fixes to UTF-8 SysTray support patch.
		* Several unicode fixes.
		* New macro in otherfunctions.h: unicode2charbuf(x) -- used
		  when you need to store a (char *) to use several times.

	Rommel:
		* Patch to implement the commands serverconnect and reloadipf
		  in amulecmd.

	ThePolish:
		* i18n amule log lines (server window)
		* amulecmd and webinterface i18n fixes
		* Some win32 fixes (slashes and backslashes)
		* Automake 1.8 fixes
		* Add traditionnal Chinese translation (zh_TW) from Paul (Thanks !)
		* Add it, nl, fr, pl, es, eu, ca translation updates (Thanks to
		  all translators)
		* Fix copyright for alc icons
		* Replace amule, wxCas, alc .ico simple icons by icons group .ico
		* Replace alcc's printf by wxLogMassage
		* Make runtime to be in seconds in amulesig.dat
		* Modify Xas to handle runtime in seconds
		* Modify wxCas to handle runtime in seconds

	Unleashed:
		* cas: some sprintf -> snprintf conversions, ifdef unix specific
		  code, and revert get_path() breakage

	Xaignar:
		* Other stuff I'm too lazy to write or have forgotten about. ;)
		* Initial multi-sorting on download list. Upon changing sort-column,
		  any items that were evaulated to equal will be resorted by the 
		  last used column.
		* Fixed the constant resetting of the category dropdown-menu in
		  the searchdlg.
		* Fixed "&"s being replaced with "&&" on the log-view.
		* Only displayed category color when the items arn't highlighted
		  on the download list, to improve readability. (thanks to Seagull)
		* Optimized the IPFilter-code.
		* Improved the CDownloadListCtrl::Updateitem function so that it 
		  doesn't search the list for hidden items.
		* Improved sorting of clients by QR on the download list.
		* Removed a number of unsued files, cutting down archive-size
		  by around 900kb.
		* Changed systray behavior to match KDE/GNOME. Single-clicks hide/show.
		* Fixed the "Last Recieved" column, which would show the 
		  same as the "Last Seen Completed" column.
		* Fixed the placement of sources on the download list, where they 
		  would sometimes be placed with the wrong file.
		* Cleanup of the new AICHSyncThread class.
		* Removed extra newlines before writing text to the logfile,
		  to avoid having a double-spaced file.
		* Fixed loading of addresses.dat, where the first line would
		  be ignored and replaced the messagebox with a log-line.
		* Fix the percentage displayed on the progress-bars being rounded,
		  which would result in non-completed files showing 100%.
		* Added the ability for the user to specify permission settings for 
		  fildes and directories. These settings default to 640 for files and
		  750 for directories and are used throughout the app, with the 
		  exception of files created with wxTextFile, as that class lacks 
		  support for permissions. Will be fixed later		  
		* Cleanup of CServerListCtrl:
		  - The sorting of the list is now always maintained, including when items 
		    on the list are updated or new items updated.
		  - Cleanup of the popup-menu.
		  - Disallow connecting to multiple servers at the same time.
		  - Other changes.
		* Reduced the overhead of the overhead calculation by using 
		  code that didn't require iterating through a list every time.
		* Added checks to avoid the user getting spammed with the "Connected
		  to user" and "Disconnected ..." when having an open chat-window.
		* Second reworking of the SearchDlg
		  - The crash on searching should be fixed now.
		  - Initial cleanups of the SearchList class
		* Cleanup of the SearchListCtrl class
		  - Results will now always be sorted
		  - Syncronized all lists during runtime, so that they behave 
		    as a single list.
		  - Improving the coloring of items.
		* Cleanup of the CMuleNotebook class
		* Cleanup of the CMuleListCtrl class:
		  - Added double-arrow for alternate sorting.
		  - Centralized a lot of logical plus lots of other changes
		* Double-buffered all listctrls using custom drawing, to reduce flicker.
		* Added warning if the user recieves LowID from the server.
		* Disallowing the user to send empty messages in the chat window.
		* Rewrote the PrefsUnifiedDlg class
		  - Removed the Rse classes and create a more clean replacement.
		  - Made the dialog mode-less.
		  - Removed the un-implemented Notify page
		  - Serveral other changes.
		* Updated the version reporting capabilities of aMule, so that it
		  will report version, wxWidgets type and version and if unicode
		  has been enabled or not.
		* Added the new MuleTextCtrl class which supports the traditional
		  popup-menu with Cut/Copy/Past/Clear and Select All. All existing
		  wxTextCtrls were replaced with this new class.
		* Imported the parts of Crypto++ that aMule needs into two files
		  with permission from the Crypto++ developer. This means that aMule 
		  now compiles without the user having Crypto++ installed, though it 
		  is still possible to use external Crypto++ installations if the user
		  wishes to do so.
		* Fixed some compilation problems with aLinkCreator and wx-2.5.2.
		* Fixed the First-Time-Message being displayed twice and rewrote it 
		  somewhat since it was becomming quite outdated.
		* Fixed the "unable to open preferences.dat" bugs.
		* Fixed the ability to add static servers.
		* Cleanup of column sorting functions.
		* Fixed a bug where CServer::HasDynIP would always return true.
		  This would result in need-less dns lookups.
		* Removed a redundant attempt at adding servers from connected 
		  clients.
		* Fix for Packet::PackPackets function where new size of packet 
		  wouldn't be saved.
		* Fixed some access to the dialog-window ptr after it had been
		  deleted. This was causing some odd behavior once in a while
		  on termination.
		* Fixed the downloadqueue sorting, which was reversed. Low-priorty 
		  files having high priority and high-priority files having low 
		  priority. (Thanks to thomas001 for noticing)
		* Rewroked the systray:
		  - Fixed the the problems with the rate-limiting functionality.
		  - Enabled use of PublicIP requests, so that the tray will show
		    the users actual IP rather than the interface IP.
		  - Some changes of the menu-structure.
		* Complete reworking of the hashing thread:
		  - More informative output
		  - Much better error handling
		  - Handles duplicate files gracefully
		  - Reads only 128kb (instead of 9mb) at a time to avoid killing 
		    the harddisk entirely while the thread is running.
		  - Made the thread terminate when no files are left, instead
		    of timing out as before.
		* Disconnected otherfunctions.h from the rest of the aMule code,
		  so that it should be possible to use it in external apps.
		* Added checks when using the client-pointer in the socket-code,
		  since that suffered from the same problem as the previously 
		  fixed clients (they have a habbit of dying at random).
		* Added function for truncanating displayed filenames, which is now
		  used in file-details dialog, to avoid it getting resized to 
		  extreme widths.
		* Some work on readying the Info tab on servers, deltaHF_ did the
		  rest of the work.
		* Small re-fix for the "mis-matching hash"-bug fix
		* Reworked the SearchDlg once
		  - Added Jugle.net websearch
		  - Added results-count to the result tabs
		  - Other smaller changes 
		* Fixed mem-leak where certian client-objects wouldn't be deleted. 
		  Specifically those that were removed from the download queue but 
		  wern't on the upload queue and didn't have a active socket.
		* Removed debugging functionality no longer needed.
		* Removed variable-arguments logging functions, since they were 
		  only needed in a very few places and posed a potential risk 
		  everywhere else.
		* Fixed StripInvalidFilenameChars function to avoid legit letters
		  being dropped (thanks to likesylph).
		* Changed all file-accessing to use CFile rather than a mix of CFile, 
		  wxFile and FILE.
		
		* Removed a number of warnings.
		* Cleanups of the following files
		  - AICHSyncThread.*
		  - ServerListCtrl.*
		  - SearchListCtrl.*
		  - MuleNotebook.*
		  - MuleListCtrl.*
		  - PrefsUnifiedDlg.*
		  - SysTray.*
		  - AddFileThread.*
		  - SearchDlg.*
		  - CMemFile.h and filemem.cpp
		  - SafeFiles.*
		  - CFile.*

		
	Special Thanks To:
		* Lucasvr, for providing fixes for compilation with some wx versions.
		* Seagull, for providing fixes and suggestions.
		* likesylph, for providing a fix for the StripInvalidFilenameChars function.
		* All translators
		* All testers
		* BrianHV and the people at #wxwidgets for their help and support
		* EVERYONE at #amule (even codewarrior2!)
		* All the people in aMule's forum
		* All the users, for having the patience to wait the delayed rc6 release.
		* Hellimod, one_2_one, ASTIOBOY, sssnake, lami123, Ocimin, agav,  PowerMike
		   and all the mac testers and people providing Macs for ssh & vnc. 

	Funny stuff about this changelog:
		* You can notice that the Search dialog was rewritten 3 (THREE!) times
		   between rc5 and rc6. You only get to see the final version (Xaignar's), 
		   but the initial one was Kry's (when the extended buttons show/hide 
		   were added) and then deltaHF changed it later. 
		   We just love changing that page.

Version 2.0.0rc5 - The 'Let's recover our release speed' version.
----------
2004-07-18

	deltaHF:
	        * Better sorting of some columns

	Kry:
		* Some gui design and coding of the upcoming Kad window
		* Protocol update:
			* UDP protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
			* TCP Standard Base protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
			* TCP Extended Base protocol upgraded to eMule 0.43b
		* Fixed memory corruption and crashes on 'cas'
		* Fixed gsocket-2.5.c for big endian archs.
		* Fixed CFile class to actually return error when a error ocurred and not only when it feels like.
		* Fixed bug where the 'All' category could be removed leading to crashes and other funny behaviours.
		* No more minimize when no tray has been selected.
		* Fixed browse skin file button to actually browse a file ;)
		* Fixed high 32 bits of transfered bytes not being loaded on known.met (sorry fluffly!)
		* Some Mac bugfixes.

	Hetfield:
		* Some gcc 3.4.x compilation fixes

	lfroen:
		* GUIEvents updated 
		* core2gui events added.
		* Some gcc 3.4 fixes to GUIEvents

	Phoenix:
		* Added a test with a warning to
		  CSearchDlg::OnBnClickedSdownload in SearchDlg.cpp. A NULL
		  value has been reported on the foruns, we don't know how
		  GetPage() or FindWindowById() could have returned NULL.
		* More unicode fixes to alcc and ed2khash.
		* Fixed flags for console applications. -DwxUSE_GUI=0 is
		  required so that amuleweb, amulecmd, etc, run fine with
		  wxWidgets version 2.5.2 and up.
		* Fixed a problem with gsocket-2.5.c when using wxWidgets
		  version 2.5.2 and up. Now amule runs with 2.5.2.
		* New ipfilter code.
		* Found the reason why wx-2.5.2 gui was messed: starting with
		  wx-2.5.2, a new flag must be added when adding components to
		  sizers to keep the old behaviour (wxFIXED_MINSIZE). This
		  constant is defined to zero in amule.h when wx-version is
		  less than 2.5.2, so that amule still compiles in old wx.
	
	ThePolish:
		 * Add win32 MakefileWIN32, configureWIN32.h and project file amule.msp
		 * Make win32 use winsock2 for IPFilter
		 * Enable alc, alcc, wxCas translations with aMule catalog
		 * Use normalized includes for wx in wxCas, alc and alcc
		 * Limit the server name length in wxCas to avoid a too large window
		 * New icon for alc
		 * Global fr translation
		 * Fix win32 ToolBar problem

	Xaignar:
		* Added the ability to search for "Texts"	
		* Attempt at fixing both Random Socket Bugs and Random Client Bugs.
		* Fixed new IPFilter code.
		* Cleanup of CPartFile::SavePartFile
		* Got rid of some unneeded includes.
		* Fixed compilation when using crypto++ 5.2
		* Ensuring that the ServerListCtrl gets unfrozen in case of corrupted met files.
		* Fixed a crash-bug added by Kry's UDP commit.

	Special thanks to:
		* The usual people, those on the other 'Thank you!' sections of changelog.
		* All the people at the Mac section of forums, for testing compilation and run.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.0-rc2 - The 'white rabbit' version.
-------------
2004-04-11

	aquatroll:
	
		* Fixed Win32 compilation (again).

	Ariel:
	
		* Implemented completed parts count on file rehash.
		   Prevents your downloads to completely lost on a wrong .part.met write.
		   
	croakerc:
	        * Added zlib version check
		* *BSD compatibility
		
	deltaHF:
	
	        * New icon for aMule in DL/UP window ;)
		* curl-config now >= 7.9.5 (for debian)
		* i18n stuff
		* Removed double catalan entry from prefs
		* Fixed some typos

	falso:
	
		* Added cas (C aMule Statistics), a remake of aStats but 10 times faster (still lack online sign).
		* amulesign.dat now shows the Total transfered values in bytes.
		* Added Session upload and download to amulesign and uptime too.
	
	Hetfield:
	
		* Added new inclusion path if distro in not detected
		* fixed wrong and duplicated inclusion in ClientCredits.*
		* Modified configure scripts, only amule is compiled by default
		* Added cas, ed2k, amulecmd, amulegui, amule webserver, amule webserver gui
		* fixed wrong zlib check in configure    
		
	hoschy, one-2-one, godard, PowerMike, hellimod:
	
	        * MacOSX stuff
		
	Jacobo221:
	
	        * Compiled the RC1 bugs and provided support on forums. It's our man-for-all.
		  	
	Kry:
	
		* Implemented the Complete count on search results and on file publishing.
		   This feature added since aMule 2.0.0-rc1 and eMule 0.42e was not released
		   with the rc1 for network technical reasons (still on testing with lugdunummaster).
		   When publishing a file, we also inform the server if the file is complete or not.
		   Search results show the count of complete sources sent by the server next to the sources
		   found: i.e. 100 (28) meaning 100 sources, 28 of them complete (72 incomplete or old client)
		* Added sending of the extended eMule version using aMule version, with additional rc version
		* Added parsing of the new 0.4x eMule tags on hello packets.		
		* Added parsing the Secure Ident packets for new eMule versions. Reduce overhead on download/upload.
		* Added HandShake check on upload request.
		* Rewrote display of client version on transfers page to handle the client soft/version correctly on any client.
		   That means eDonkeyHybrids and eMule does show now the correct version (i.e edonkey 0.50.1 or emule 0.42d)
		   aMule shows now as either "aMule 1.x (based on eMule v0.xx)" (<= 2.0.0-rc1) or aMule "A.B.C-rcX" (>= 2.0.0-rc2)
		* Fixed Mule Info packet only sent to eMule clients. Now is sent to old eMule && eMule-like clients (compatible clients)
		* Added 'Allocate Full Part File" and "Allocate Full Chunk" to preferences. None functional yet.
		* Fixed Client Detail Dialog to show correct client version.
		* Fixed comment mark on Download list being cut on the display.
		* Fixed the crashes on Base Client packets.
		* aMule now loads .par.met.BAK if the .part.met is 0-size (added to Ariel's commit, this prevents losing met files).
		* Made SafeMem files really safe checking for read after end of file.
		* Fixed wrong Modversion data (fixes random crash too)
		* Fixed assert on wrong upload list control data.
		* Fixed several crashes on wxString::GetData usage.
		* Fixed UDP disable button not being saved across sessions

		* Locale goes to System Default on new version now (fixes weird language problems)
		* Fixed wrong OP_REASKFILEPING packets being sent .
		* Reverted GAddress_INET functions to standard inet_addr ones.
		* Completely removed list refresh functions. CPU saved was not worth it.
		* Added CheckDiskSpace checkbox and radio button to the preferences.
		* Added the scale of the connections graph on stats. (only rescaled on restart)
		* Added 'Reset' button for Server Log
		* Fixed: Right click popup on server connected was showing 'connect' now shows 'reconnect'.
		* gscocket shouldn't be compiled on Mac, and so it's not compiled now ;)
		* Fixed Preview of already completed files not working.
		* Fixed files > 2Gb not working on fast ed2k links handler and ed2k app.
		* Fixed file size for files larger then 2Gb displayed incorrectly
		* Changed timeout of curl functions to 10 - fixes hangups when clicking server update without
		   internet conenction.
		* We don't share 0 size files anymore.
		* Fixed the crash on invalid socket using 5 different ways. The last one seems to be the most stable.
		* Fixed several hangups on file completion.
		* Fixed % and progressbar not being updated when changed on GUI Tweaks.
		* Fixed comment packets. This was causing disconection from eMule clients (and crashing aMule clients)
		* Fixed amule dissapearing because sent to systray when --disable-systray was used.
		* Fixed memleak on search packet sent.
		* Fixed memleak on KnownFile deletion
		* Fixed memleak on search results received.
		* Fixed memleak on comment packet received.
		* Speeded up socket event handling.
		* Cleaned server connection. No more 'inet connection might be down' - unless it's down ;)
		* Faster PartFile processing.
		* Fixed endian issue on PartFile loading.
		* Fixed non-needed delete of an array on the notebook destructor.
		* Doesn't allow an incoming packet to get processed if socket is deleting.
		* Fixed double-highlight of servers if disconnected by the server.
		* Speeded up hashing of the files a lot. This should fix the gui hangs at startup.
		* Removed all old preferences code. That makes the app smaller, less memory used, and avoid some
		   unexpected bugs that arised on having 2 preferences implementation. Now New Prefs become Preferences.
		* Fixed SysTray and gtk-files being compiled even when disabled on configure.
		* Fixed several warnings.
		* Fixed assert on Clear All (search)
		* Make aMule compile on wxWidgets 2.5 (and CVS) version.
		
	Madcat:
	
	        * win32 LaunchUrl() function
		* Added amule-win32.HOWTO.txt
		* Better win32 version of Hostname() function

	shakraw:
	
		* WebSocket.* & WebServer.*: now uses wxThreads and
		  wxSockets to be cross platform.
		* Better threads' array remove in WebSocket
		* WebServer cleanly stopped before exit
		* Fixed multiple file download bug in webserver search section
		* Fixed ed2k download link
		* Fixed categories for web interface
		  
	thepolish:
	
	        * win32 stuff
		
	Unleashed:
	
	        * Memleak fix
		  
	Xaignar:
	
		* Amule no longer writes met files when priority is changed through the
		   auto-priority subsystem. Thus hd-writes are substancially reduced 
		   depending on the number of files set to auto-priority.
		* Fixed bug where text fields overlap each other (Disp. 4 & 5)
		* Cleanup of amuleDlg.*
		* aMule no longer displays a message about not being able to open the 
		   file "lastversion" the first time it is run
		* Changed the CTypedPtrList filelist in DownloadQueue.* to a std::deque,
		   with a speed-increase as a result
		* Fixed the bug where the background of previously selected items in the
		   friendslist wouldn't be redrawn (Disp. 2)
		* Fixed auto-priority. Priority would be set one tad too high, resulting
		   in the downloadlist failing to assign a name to the priority, thus 
		   leaving empty fields. Also fixed displaying of priorty "Auto [Lo]" 
		   in sharedfiles-list. (Tran. 3)
		* Fixed the problem where "completed percent" of files that hadn't 
		   transfered any bits yet would display a negative percentage (Disp. 8)
