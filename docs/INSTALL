 Requirements
--------------

  To compile aMule, you'll need at least the following packages:
    * zlib >= 1.1.4       (1.2.3 is recommended)
    * wxWidgets >= 2.8.0  (2.8.9 is recommended)
    * Crypto++ >= 5.1     (5.5.2 is recommended)
    * the perl File::Copy module

  For aMuleWeb you'll also need:
    * a POSIX compliant regex library (like libgnurx or libregex, for most
      GNU systems it's part of the standard C library).

  Optionally you may want to provide:
    * libgd (or gdlib) >= 2.0.0, to let cas generate statistics images;
    * libupnp >= 1.6.6 if you want to have UPnP support;
    * libpng >= 1.2.0 to let aMuleWeb generate nice statistics graphs;
    * libGeoIP >= 1.4.4 if you want colourful country flags and IP to country
      mappings in the GUI;
    * gettext >= 0.11.5 if you want to enable NLS (Native Language Support).

  It is known to compile with GCC 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3;
  Sun Studio 12 and MSVC. GCC 2.95 is not supported.

  aMule requires a wxWidgets builds that supports unicode. Since wxWidgets
  does not support unicode with GTK1, it is not possible to make aMule use
  GTK1.

  As Crypto++ is very sensitive to compiler defects, if you're compiling it
  from source be sure to always test your compilation with `cryptest.exe v'.
  (Yes, it's called cryptest.exe on all platforms.) Only when all tests
  passed may you safely go on with compiling aMule.
  Adding "-DCRYPTOPP_DISABLE_ASM -O1" to CXXFLAGS is known to resolve
  these problems.


 Compiling aMule
-----------------

  Compiling and installing aMule is as easy as running the usual

    ./configure
    make
    make install

  commands (if you have all the above requirements fulfilled, of course).

  Solutions for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and the free Express Edition
  are included. Please see the readme file for more information.

    --disable-debug           disable additional debugging output
    --enable-optimize         enable code optimizing
    --enable-amulecmd         compile aMule command line client
    --enable-amule-gui        compile aMule remote GUI (EXPERIMENTAL)
    --enable-amule-daemon     compile aMule daemon version
    --enable-webserver        compile aMule WebServer
    --enable-cas              compile C aMule Statistics
    --enable-wxcas            compile aMule GUI Statistics
    --disable-ed2k            don't compile aMule ed2k links handler
    --enable-alc              compile aMuleLinkCreator GUI version
    --enable-alcc             compile aMuleLinkCreator for console
    --disable-monolithic      disable building of the monolithic aMule app

  For a full list of available options run `./configure --help' from the
